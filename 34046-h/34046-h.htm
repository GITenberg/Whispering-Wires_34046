<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE WHISPERING VOICE&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>In the greatest city of the modern world, in
the Metropolis of Guilt and Guile&mdash;where
Alias and Alibi ride in gum-shod limousines
while Mary Smith of the pure heart walks the
pavements with broken shoes&mdash;there is a mansion
so rich and so rare that it stands alone.</p>

<p>Turret and tower, green-bronze roof, Cararra-marbled
portico and iron-grilled gates
brought from Hyderabad, have made this mansion
the show place and the Peri&#8217;s paradise for
those who parade the Avenue called Fifth, in an
unending sash of fashion.</p>

<p>Out from this palace at the close of a winter&#8217;s
day, there flashed the tiny pulsations of voice-induced
currents of electricity which reached
the telephone-central, were plugged upon the
proper underground paper-insulated wires and
entered, even as the voice was speaking, the
cloud-hung office of Detective Drew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>Triggy Drew, as he was called, was dark,
stout and forty-one years of age to a month.
He crooked his elbow, removed his cigar and
pressed the telephone-receiver to his ear.</p>

<p>The voice that came over the whispering
wires was as clear as a bell within a bell. It
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Montgomery Stockbridge wants you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew hung up the telephone-receiver. He replaced
the cigar in his mouth. He wheeled in
his chair and pressed a buzzer. To the operative
who entered he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney, watch things while I&#8217;m gone. I&#8217;m
called up-town!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative reached and handed Drew his
coat. He took the swivel-chair before the desk,
as his chief clapped on a hat, turned his eyes
toward the ground-glass door, and passed out
with a brisk stride.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big case,&#8221; said Delaney leaning back.
&#8220;Triggy is on somebody&#8217;s trail. Maybe German&mdash;maybe
not!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew nodded to the waiting operatives in the
outer room of the suite. He swung into the
hallway with his brown eyes glowing like a
man who walked out of realism into romance.</p>

<p>The elevator plumbed eighteen stories. The
corridor was clear. A taxi stood at the curb.
Into this Drew stepped, gave the address and
was gently seated as the driver released his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>brake, set the meter, and dropped through first,
second and into third speed.</p>

<p>Past Wall Street the taxi flashed. It rounded
toward the Bowery, which showed that the
driver knew his map. It struck up through the
car tracks, across to Washington Park and there
took the long longitude of Fifth Avenue as the
shortest and quickest way up-town.</p>

<p>Drew had no eye for the passers-by. He was
repeating two words over and over like a novice
counting the same beads. Montgomery Stockbridge
was a name to conjure with in the Bagdad
of Seven Million. He had made many enemies
and much money. His wealth ran well
above seven figures.</p>

<p>The taxi came to a gliding halt. Drew stepped
out in front of a church. He tossed the driver
two one-dollar bills and some silver. He waited
as the taxi merged in the traffic. He turned and
glanced keenly up and down the Avenue. Then
he hurried north for one square, paused before
the mansion of turrets and towers, and pressed
a button which was set in the doorway.</p>

<p>The door opened to a crack, then wide. A
butler barred the way. To him Drew said, &#8220;Mr.
Stockbridge sent for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler bowed with old world civility. He
took the detective&#8217;s hat and coat. He waited until
Drew removed his gloves. He bowed for
a second time and led the way over rugs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>whose pile was as thick as some Persian temple&#8217;s.
They came finally, after an aisle of old
masters, to the inner circle of latter-day finance
and money-wizardry&mdash;the celebrated library of
Montgomery Stockbridge.</p>

<p>The Munition Magnate sat there. He turned
as the butler announced the detective. He shot
a gray-thatched pair of eyes up and over a mahogany
table upon which a white envelope lay.
He smiled coldly. His thumb jerked toward a
leather chair into which Drew sank and leaned
his elbows upon the table.</p>

<p>Stockbridge coughed dryly. He blinked and
studied the detective&#8217;s face for a long minute.
He glanced from the envelope up at a cone of
rose light which hung from a cluster of electric-globes.
His expression, seen in this light, was
like an aged lion brought to bay. His wrinkled
skin was tawny. His hands coiled and uncoiled
like claws. They moved prehensilely, as though
cobwebs were in that perfumed air of wealth
and security. They poised over the envelope as
if to snatch the secret or delusion hidden there.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that letter!&#8221; declared the Munition
Magnate, closing his fist and banging the table.
&#8220;See it? D&#8217;ye see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew widened his eyes at the outburst. He
crossed his legs and nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s blackmail!&#8221; Stockbridge snarled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>&#8220;Rank-scented blackmail of the cheapest order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A threat of some kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Threat? Yes&mdash;a threat, in a way. It&#8217;s
clever, but it won&#8217;t <i>work</i> with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew recrossed his legs. He touched his
short-cropped mustache with the fingers of his
right hand. He coughed as in suggestion. His
brows lifted as he studied the envelope from a
distance.</p>

<p>Stockbridge snatched it up suddenly. He
slapped it against the edge of the polished table.
He turned and found a cigar to his liking out
of many in a humidor beneath a smaller table
at the right of his chair. He bit on this cigar,
struck a match, and dragged in the smoke with
deep inhalings before he turned and opened the
envelope, exposing a letter which he rapped
with the knuckles of his left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll beg to be excused,&#8221; he said half-apologetically.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not myself. This letter, you
know. I want you to ferret it out. I want you
to find out who sent it, and make him or her
pay. Make them pay in full!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge hesitated. His eyes ran across
the paper. His lips curled in an ugly, thin-visaged
smile which wrinkled his yellow face.
&#8220;See it? Yes!&#8221; he snapped, volplaning the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>sheet across the table with a vicious jerk of his
wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ridgewood Cemetery,&#8221; said Drew lifting
the letter. &#8220;Heading, Ridgewood Cemetery,&#8221;
he repeated softly. &#8220;Dated yesterday,&#8221; he added
with a sly glance at Stockbridge. &#8220;Signed by
the superintendent, I suppose. Yes, by the superintendent.
He scrawls worse than I do.
Well, it looks official and smells&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge worked his brows up and down
like a gorilla. He chewed on his cigar with
savage grinding of gold-filled teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smells graveyardy,&#8221; continued Drew. &#8220;I
get flowers and urns and new-turned earth.
This seems to be the bare announcement that
the grave you ordered dug in the family plot&mdash;is
ready and waiting.&#8221; Drew glanced up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; sneered the Magnate.</p>

<p>Drew stroked his upper lip. He turned the
letter over. He held it to the rose-light and
studied the water-mark. He raised his black
brows and said sepulchrally:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge stiffened. &#8220;Dead?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Why, nobody is dead! Damn it,
Drew, there&#8217;s nobody dead at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective frowned. &#8220;Somebody in the
immediate family?&#8221; he questioned. &#8220;Somebody
you are expecting to pass away soon? Some
one on their sick-bed, for instance?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>Stockbridge snatched the cigar from his
mouth and threw it to the rug. &#8220;That letter&#8217;s
a stab, Drew!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
damn insult to me and mine, if you want to
know. I&#8217;ll have the author of it, or know the
reason why. I&#8217;ll spend fifty thousand to catch
the miscreants. They&#8217;ll not monkey with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The writer of this seems to be the superintendent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that part&#8217;s all right. He knows nothing
save what you see there. This threat concerns
Loris and I. We are the only two who
will ever be buried in our family plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she know? Has she seen this
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knows nothing about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has no enemies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not! She&#8217;s just a girl!&#8221; The
Magnate&#8217;s eyes softened slightly. He glanced
around for a cigar.</p>

<p>Drew laid the letter on the table. &#8220;It seems
to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you have not explained
everything. When did you get this letter, Mr.
Stockbridge? What time did it arrive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came in the late mail last night. I showed
it to Loris at supper. Then I called up the
cemetery people this morning. Got the superintendent.
He said that &#8216;Dr. Conroy&#8217;&mdash;our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>family physician&mdash;&#8216;had phoned him and ordered
the grave dug.&#8217; Said, &#8216;A death was about to
occur in the Stockbridge family.&#8217; Conroy never
sent any such message!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; broke in Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! He assured me of it. Was terribly
put out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; said Drew, &#8220;that the entire
matter is a practical joke of the low order.
I see nothing else to it&mdash;so far. It isn&#8217;t even
clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; Stockbridge said huskily.
&#8220;It may be <i>very</i> clever. It may mean that
death is coming&mdash;to me or to Loris. There&#8217;s
men in this city who are capable of anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>The break in the Magnate&#8217;s voice brought
Drew to the edge of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221; he asked professionally.
&#8220;Motive goes before crime&mdash;you
know. Sometimes a warning is sent&mdash;more
often there is none. Clever men do not telegraph
a blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspect the whole city!&#8221; declared Stockbridge.</p>

<p>Drew smiled sincerely. It was plainly evident
that the Magnate was suffering from the thrust
about Loris and the graveyard. The detective
had never seen him so unsettled.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about Germans?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
made a lot of ammunition&mdash;haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>&#8220;Ye&mdash;s. I&#8217;ve still holdings in Standard Shell,
Preferred, and Amalgamated Powder. Also,
there is my interest in Flying Boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could the Germans be after you for any
reason at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Magnate weighed the question from a
score of angles. He reached and secured a second
cigar. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; he said with a
dark frown. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they would bother
with me. I&#8217;m more or less retired. I&#8217;ve drawn
out of a lot of things. Younger men are turning
out the ammunition now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then which of your friends might be responsible
for this letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well put!&#8221; exclaimed Stockbridge.
<i>&#8220;Friends</i> may be right. Friends now, or former
friends who have rounded on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name some!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Morphy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We settled him. We should never hear from
him again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure! You don&#8217;t know him like I
know him. He&#8217;s a vindictive devil! He got ten
to twenty years in state prison. You remember
the case. He lost his appeal to the Governor,
only last week. I blocked it through Tammany
affiliations. You know what that fiend in stripes
is capable of doing. He would sell his soul to
get me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew grew serious. &#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>&#8220;Then there is&mdash;well, there are others. Ten,
at least! What man can rise in this slippery
city without pushing a few down the ladder?
Wall Street and Broad Street and New Street
are full of curb-stone blackmailers who knew
me when I was struggling with my companies.
They saw me take chances they themselves
feared to take. They hounded me, then. Thank
God, I got above them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew leaned over the table. &#8220;A few names,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Something specific. Who of all of
them would be capable of phoning the cemetery,
representing himself to be your family physician
and ordering the grave dug? Who might
think of a thing like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s Harry Nichols, for instance.
He&#8217;s an ass with a champagne thirst and a
shoestring salary. I threw him out of the house
the other day. He was calling on Loris. Think
of that! He&#8217;s probably sworn to get me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About twenty-three&mdash;or four! Smokes,
drinks and plays golf!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name some others,&#8221; suggested Drew artfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphy&#8217;s brother who escaped when we
had Morphy indicted. I don&#8217;t know where he
is. Then there&#8217;s Vogel and Vogel&#8217;s friends.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>Oh, there&#8217;s a pirate crew of them. Some were
mixed up in the first Flying Boat failure. They
would all like to see me in Ridgewood Cemetery.
I&#8217;ll fool them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me Harry Nichols, Morphy,
Morphy&#8217;s brother, Vogel and Vogel&#8217;s friends.
That&#8217;s four and a few outsiders. Can you think
of any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at present! One of them is responsible
for this letter. I want you to get busy. If
you won&#8217;t take the case, I&#8217;ll get an agency that
will. There&#8217;s plenty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll handle it,&#8221; said Drew, &#8220;when it gets
to be a case. As it is now, Mr. Stockbridge<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buuurrruuurrr! Buuurrruuurrr! Buuurrruuurrr!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Magnate started. He lowered his cigar,
balanced it on the edge of the table, and turned
slowly in his chair. He leaned over a smaller
table which was littered with bronze ash-trays
and inlaid match-boxes. He lifted the receiver
of the insistent telephone. He pressed this to
his ear.</p>

<p>Drew watched him narrowly. The terseness
of a static charge of high voltage was in the
great library. The face of the Munition Magnate
grew cold with hauteur. It changed over
the seconds to venom and red anger. His neck
purpled. The diaphragm of the telephone instrument
hissed its message. His hand clutched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>the hard-rubber receiver with white strength.
A click followed as the connection was broken.
Stockbridge dropped the receiver upon the
hook. He turned slowly and stared at Drew
with eyes that had aged over the moments.
Wrinkles shot from their corners. Sullen light
gleamed in their yellow depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; questioned Drew half
rising from his chair and leaning over. &#8220;Who
phoned?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Magnate&#8217;s chin described an upward arc.
His lips grew firm. Bulges showed at the sides
of his jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;who was it?&#8221; asked the detective.</p>

<p>Stockbridge stared at the letter upon the
table. His neck changed from purple to a pasty
ochre. A green sheen, like of death, overspread
his crafty features. He was stricken with the
clutch of fear.</p>

<p>Drew waited and thought rapidly. &#8220;What
happened?&#8221; he asked with persuasion. &#8220;Nothing
serious&mdash;I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Serious,&#8221; said Stockbridge absently. &#8220;Serious!&#8221;
he snarled. &#8220;Yes, it was serious! It
was a death threat! It was what I had expected.
It follows the letter. They&mdash;he will get
me! He&mdash;he<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked the detective.</p>

<p>Drew heard the table creaking as Stockbridge&#8217;s
muscles stiffened&mdash;as the Magnate&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>hands clutched the edge of the polished surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he repeated on the alert for possible
clews.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who! I don&#8217;t know! But they will&mdash;he
will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Take it easy, sir. This
is a modern age. We are in the heart of civilization.
Nobody is going to <i>get</i> you! I&#8217;ll see
to that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t see! This man knows everything.
He said that I would be dead within twelve
hours. That I would be in my grave in seventy-two
hours. He mentioned the grave at Green&mdash;Ridgewood Cemetery. He gave secret details
of my life which few alone know. Early follies
of mine. An actress. A deal in War Babies
and an electrical stock which was hushed up.
I was the silent partner in that. How should
this man know all of these things about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you! He said enough! He threatened
to kill me despite all the precautions I
would take. He said I was marked for a death
which all the police in the world couldn&#8217;t solve.
That I would be killed in spite of every effort
to save me. What is it&mdash;poison? Have I already
been given poison?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew reached across the table and clutched
the magnate&#8217;s left wrist. He pulled out a flat
watch and timed the pulse. &#8220;Normal, almost,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>he said softly. &#8220;You&#8217;re normal, despite the
shock. Your temperature is fair. I don&#8217;t think
it was a toxin he meant. That deadens a man
and brings slow coma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what did he mean?&#8221; The magnate
had found his voice and his old-time nerve.
&#8220;What would you do in my case?&#8221; he said
cunningly.</p>

<p>Drew glanced at the telephone. He raised his
brows and swung, full-staring, upon Stockbridge.
His finger pointed between the money-king&#8217;s
eyes. It was as steady as an automatic
revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you recognize that voice?&#8221; he asked
sharply. &#8220;Tell me the facts. I can&#8217;t go ahead
unless you do. I must work from facts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; declared Stockbridge. &#8220;No, I did
not! I never heard it before. I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollow-whispering&mdash;almost feminine in
tone. I thought it was a woman at first. It
wasn&#8217;t, though! It was a man or boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you told me everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;except this man or boy&mdash;this whispering
voice, wound up by threatening to get my
daughter, Loris, as soon as he finished with me.
Said he&#8217;d clean up with her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the case!&#8221; snapped Drew.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch02'></a>
<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>CHAPTER TWO</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE MAGPIE&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The Munition Magnate thrust a shaking
hand toward the detective. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad!&#8221;
he declared raising his voice. &#8220;You did
well in the Morphy case. That&#8217;s the reason I
called upon you. Now find the miscreant or
miscreants, who telephoned the cemetery superintendent,
and you&#8217;ll not be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced shrewdly at the &#8217;phone. &#8220;May
I use it?&#8221; he asked briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try to trace
that call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge moved his chair away from the
little table. Drew glided across the room,
pressed the ash-trays and match-boxes to one
side, and picked up the receiver. He worked
the hook up and down with his broad thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; he repeated clicking the
hook. &#8220;Hello, central! Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at Stockbridge as he waited. He
frowned as he stooped and spoke more directly
into the transmitter. &#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something the matter?&#8221; asked the Magnate
with quick suspicion. &#8220;Don&#8217;t they answer?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>&#8220;Hello! Hello! I Hello, there!&#8221; Drew glared
at the transmitter, then tapped the receiver
against the silver-plated cover. &#8220;Hello!&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;Damn it, Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned. &#8220;No go,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.
&#8220;Connection seems to be broken. I&#8217;m talking
right out into thin air. Wonder who cut your
wires?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge bristled. He slid forward in his
great chair and stared at the detective.
&#8220;They&#8217;re cut, eh?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Drew set the &#8217;phone on the table and turned.
&#8220;Looks mighty like it,&#8221; he said. His eyes
swung over the walls of the splendid room.
They rested upon a high, ebony stand with a
belfry from which dangled a gilt spring suspending
an ornate bird cage. Out of this cage,
a magpie peered with beaded eyes. Its tail extended
up through the bars like a feather from
a hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My bird,&#8221; said Stockbridge. &#8220;A tame magpie
I brought from Spain. It talks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew raised his brows. He continued his
search of the library. Its wealth of books and
paintings and antiques almost stunned him.
&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for another &#8217;phone,&#8221; he said, lowering
his voice to a whisper. &#8220;Have you another
&#8217;phone in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Two more. This is Gramercy Hill
9763. The one in Loris&#8217; room is Gramercy Hill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>9764. Another in the butler&#8217;s pantry, downstairs,
is 9765. Perhaps the others are disconnected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see. I want that call traced before
it gets cold. I know a wire chief at Gramercy
Hill Exchange. He&#8217;ll help if I can get him.
Have your butler show me his &#8217;phone. Also,
we better get a trouble-hunter, or report the
cut wires. Somebody will pay for this! It&#8217;s
an outrage and a felony!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge moved his slippered foot and
pressed a button under the larger table. He
waited, then pressed again. His eyes wavered
about the room. They fastened upon the portières
which draped from the pole across the
doorway leading into the hall. His tongue
moistened dry lips as he watched for the butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8217;phone my office,&#8221; said Drew hurriedly
as steps were heard in the hall. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get up
five operatives&mdash;no, six&mdash;right away. This all
may be a hoax, but I&#8217;ve lived forty-one years
too long to overlook a threat of this kind. Particularly
when it concerns a man who has made
as many enemies as you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler parted the portières as Drew
ceased speaking. Stockbridge nodded and indicated
that the detective wanted to go downstairs.
The butler led the way to the lower
telephone. Into this, Drew spoke hurriedly and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>very much to the point. He secured three numbers
in rapid succession. He snapped his orders
in a manner to set the cut-glass tinkling
on the pantry shelves. He hung up the receiver,
glanced shrewdly at the servants about, then
climbed the stairs like a boy of twelve.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is set!&#8221; he announced to Stockbridge
as he entered the library and crossed to the
table. &#8220;All moving, now! My wire-chief had
gone home. I got the chief operator. She&#8217;s
going to send the first trouble-man handy. Delaney
will be up from the office with his flying
squad. I left it to him to arrange about tracing
the call through a telephone official. No use telling
the chief operator too much. The official
will go right over her head and into the heart
of the thing. Now,&#8221;&mdash;Drew pulled down the
lapels of his black coat and leaned over the
Magnate. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he said with vigor, &#8220;now,
what about your servants? I had a good look
at some of them. How about that English butler?
How long have you had him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten years! Brought him over, myself.
Wife picked the other servants. They&#8217;re all
old, tried and trusted. I&#8217;ll answer for them.
She died telling me to take care of them. I
don&#8217;t think her equal lived in choosing help.
It was uncanny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew stroked his cropped mustache.
&#8220;Good!&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine! We&#8217;ll start
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>with the supposition that they&#8217;re <i>not</i> guilty.
Are any of them of German birth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My valet is part German, but he ran away
to avoid their army. He hates the Junker
party. Says &#8216;It is responsible for the War.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you had him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That should let him out. Well,&#8221; Drew
added with a sweeping glance about the library,
&#8220;well, these big windows&mdash;how about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective advanced to the front of the
room as he asked the question. &#8220;Two,&#8221; he
mused. &#8220;Two bay-windows of the superior order.
Curtains very heavy and rich. There&#8217;s
a good catch on this one,&#8221; he added springing
upon the radiator-box. &#8220;And a good catch on
this one. Both catches are closed. Seem to
have been closed for some time. Here&#8217;s dust.
High-class housekeeper, but I&#8217;ve got her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew smiled as he ran his fingers over the
upper sash. He peered out into the Avenue
with its flowing tide of vehicles. He turned
and said to Stockbridge:</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you order your butler or doorman
to shut the outside blinds. It&#8217;s getting dark
and cold. I want to be sure that no one can
get through this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Stockbridge reaching for the
button with his toe. &#8220;Good! We&#8217;ll take every
precaution. Twelve hours will show the thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>one way or the other. Twelve hours should do
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler entered bearing a silver tray. He
set this on a mahogany tea-wagon and rolled
it to the Magnate&#8217;s chair. Drew frowned at the
sight of a black bottle and one glass. A signal
of understanding had been sent to the perfect
servant.</p>

<p>Stockbridge moistened his thin lips thirstily.
He whispered the instructions concerning the
blinds. The butler withdrew like a shadow
merging into a shadow. Drew shrugged his
shoulders and went the round of the library
with the keen, trained scrutiny of a man-hunter
and a modern operative. He paused before a
case of morocco-bound books. &#8220;These cases?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;How about them? What&#8217;s behind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Books! Books!&#8221; shrilled the magpie.</p>

<p>Drew raised his brows and swung upon the
bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;Books! Books!&#8221; repeated the pet. &#8220;Books,
books, books!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine bird,&#8221; said Drew with thought. &#8220;But
what is behind the cases, Mr. Stockbridge? I
don&#8217;t want to move them if the walls are all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>A glass clicked against the silver tray as the
Magnate answered hastily:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! They&#8217;re all right. I was here
when they were filled. I just ordered so many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>feet of books. Six hundred feet, I think it was.
I never look at them. All that I ever read is
the magazines and the financial items in the
newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pictures&mdash;paintings,&#8221; Drew said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pictures! Pictures!&#8221; repeated the magpie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; snarled Stockbridge. &#8220;Keep
quiet, Don!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bird ruffled its feathers and leaped to a
top perch. It peered from there at Drew, with
its head cocked sideways.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about them?&#8221; repeated the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had them hung by my orders,&#8221; Stockbridge
said. &#8220;They&#8217;re all right. Nothing but
a strong wall behind. No need to bother about
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is important,&#8221; Drew suggested
with a slight reproof in his voice. &#8220;Trifles may
make for the answer to the riddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Corot over there is no trifle. It cost
me thirty-five thousand dollars in France!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew lifted the lower edge of the painting
from the wall. Dust fell. He pressed his face
against the paper and looked behind the canvas.
Letting the frame back he tried the same operation
with the other paintings of size.</p>

<p>&#8220;No secret panel, or anything queer,&#8221; he
said finally as he dusted his hands. &#8220;All&#8217;s well
with the walls. Now the floor. How about
trapdoors?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; Stockbridge exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure these rugs have been taken out and cleaned
every time I go to my country-place. A trapdoor
would be noticed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to find out,&#8221; suggested Drew
glancing from the bottle to the purple face of
the Magnate. &#8220;Please answer me if you want
to get results. I&#8217;ve got to see that no one
comes into this library for the next twelve
hours. After that period of time&mdash;we can
breathe easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Stockbridge feeling the thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;This door,&#8221; Drew said. &#8220;The door to the
hall. Can it be locked securely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! It can be locked and bolted from the
inside. I often lock myself in&mdash;in<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge stiffened in his chair. He
glanced toward the portières. He leaned forward
and attempted to shield the view of the
quarter-emptied Bourbon-bottle and the used
glass, as a girl in lavender and Irish-lace swept
into the room.</p>

<p>Drew recognized Loris Stockbridge from
newspaper photos. He held his breath as she
glided by him, unseeingly. He touched his
mustache and waited. Her face, framed in
close-drawn hair the color of midnight sky,
softened perceptibly as she swished round the
great table in the center of the library and laid
an unjeweled hand upon her father&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>She turned with a start as she realized that
Stockbridge was not alone. Drew bowed with
swift courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Drew,&#8221; said the Magnate. &#8220;Mr. Drew,
my daughter, Loris.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the detective bowed. He met her level
glance with a smile in his brown eyes. She
answered it and leaned over her father&#8217;s shoulder.
Drew wheeled and fell to studying the
titles on the books. He moved to the magpie&#8217;s
cage. He extended one finger. The bird fluttered
and sprang from perch to perch.</p>

<p>Drew thrust his hands into his pockets. He
heard Loris speaking in terse, throaty tones to
her father. He could not well avoid catching
the tenor of their conversation. It concerned
the letter from the cemetery and the threat of
death within twelve hours, which the Magnate
repeated to her with a softness in his aged
voice.</p>

<p>A gushing torrent of unbridled emotion
poured down upon his gray head. The girl
paced the floor between the chair and the table.
She fell to her knees with swift grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful, father,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;You must
be so careful. Remember you&#8217;re all that I have,
now. That letter and that telephone call means
that somebody is planning to destroy you. Oh,
father, be careful. What would happen if you
were taken away from me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d marry that cad&mdash;Nichols!&#8221; blurted
Stockbridge. &#8220;I&#8217;m the one thing that stands in
his way. You&#8217;d marry him&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rose proudly. Drew, from the shadow
outside the rose-light, studied the slender
figure crowned with a close-drawn turban of
blue-black hair. His eyes ranged down to her
slipper heels. They lifted again. He stroked
his chin as he waited for her answer. It came
truthfully enough and with high spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll marry him some day. I want your
permission, but with it or without it, father,
I am going to marry him. He&#8217;s a captain in
the Army. Doesn&#8217;t that prove he is not all the
things you said he was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good girl,&#8221; said Drew in whispered admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;It proves nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Stockbridge
stiffening in his chair and half rising. &#8220;He&#8217;s
a cad and an ass under all his uniform. He&#8217;s
too poor to be considered for one moment. I
want my daughter to marry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom she pleases,&#8221; said Loris. &#8220;Harry
may be poor, but he&#8217;s not too proud to fight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! They get those uniforms so the girls
will notice them. What does he know about
war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been at Plattsburg for three months.
He&#8217;s in town on furlough. He&#8217;s helping us with
Red Cross work. Isn&#8217;t that noble!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;That part&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said the Magnate.
&#8220;I want you to keep him from me, that&#8217;s all.
I believe he&#8217;s half German!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not! Harry is all-American. His
mother was born of German parents in this
country. His father was Canadian. You&#8217;ve
heard of the Nichols who built part of the
Grand Trunk Railroad. Was he German?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge paled under the torrent which
gushed from the girl&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right,&#8221; he said resignedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
bring him here or allow him to call. I&#8217;ve too
much to think about to worry over Harry
Nichols. You better go to your room and think
things over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris glanced at her wrist-watch. She leaned
with quick motion and kissed her father on the
forehead. She turned at the portières and
threw back her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, Mr. Drew,&#8221; she said prettily. &#8220;I
hope that you have not been annoyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective, naturally quick at answering,
found his tongue tied in his mouth. He stammered
a reply, which was too late. Loris
swished through the curtains, leaving the room
empty for her passing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A mighty fine girl,&#8221; was Drew&#8217;s whispered
comment. &#8220;They don&#8217;t often come like that.
She&#8217;s very high class. She&#8217;s got spirit. I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>hate to snatch a delusion from that young
lady&mdash;Harry Nichols, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here!&#8221; broke in Stockbridge.</p>

<p>Drew crossed the rugs. He stood by the
magnate&#8217;s side. He watched him pour out a
half-glass of Bourbon and take the whisky neat.
He frowned. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word from your men or the telephone
company?&#8221; asked Stockbridge, wiping his
mouth with the back of his hand. &#8220;That&#8217;s
queer, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew took out his watch. He replaced it
after a glance at the dial. His eyes wandered
to a little Sèvres clock on a book-case. &#8220;It&#8217;s
time for both,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somebody now&mdash;go see,&#8221; Stockbridge
whispered tersely. &#8220;Somebody is in the
hallway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The portières parted and revealed the beef-red
face of the English butler. He advanced
a step.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble-man from the telephone company
is &#8217;ere, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s &#8217;ere! &#8217;E&#8217;s
been hover the junctions in the halley, sir. &#8217;E&#8217;s
looked at the junction-box. &#8217;E says, sir, there&#8217;s
no trouble there. &#8217;E says &#8216;it must be in &#8217;ere,
sir.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In &#8217;ere, sir,&#8221; repeated the magpie with a
loud squawking and rustle of wings. &#8220;Junction-box!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>Junction-box!&#8221; it cried with its head
through the gilded bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, Don!&#8221; ordered Stockbridge. &#8220;Be
a good bird,&#8221; he added sharply. &#8220;Now, Straker,
you may show the trouble-hunter up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble-hunter! Trouble-hunter!&#8221; echoed
the magpie.</p>

<p>Drew, somewhat amused, thrust his hands in
the pockets of his coat and eyed the opening
between the curtains. A click of tools sounded
metallically. A shambling step was in the hallway.</p>

<p>&#8220;This woiy,&#8221; said the butler in a superior
tone. &#8220;Right this woiy, you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The portières parted. A slouching figure,
with a greasy cap drawn far down over the
eyes, entered the library with a lineman&#8217;s satchel
on his hip. He swung the strap from his
shoulder, glanced at Stockbridge and then at
the detective. He dropped the satchel to the
floor and scratched his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a look at this &#8217;phone,&#8221; said Drew.
&#8220;Go over the wires. Look for any cuts. The
trouble ought not to be in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge rose and made room for the lineman,
who lifted the satchel and strode to the
&#8217;phone. He dropped to one knee by the little
table. He fished forth a testing-set from his
shirt. It was bound with two leads of cotton-insulated
wire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll test here,&#8221; he suggested, clamping a set
of claws into the wires which came through the
molding and entered the ringing-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hello, this you, Saidee?
Say, Saidee, give me Franklin Official, seventeen.
Yes ... all right! Hello! This you,
Tupper? Say, Tupper, I went over the junction-box
in the alley back of the house. Everything
O. K. there. I&#8217;ll go over the leads in the
house. Loose connection somewhere, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>A clicking of tools followed as the lineman
selected a pair of pliers. They rattled over the
binding-posts at the receiver. They tightened
the connections. He went over the transmitter,
and then every inch of the exposed wiring. He
removed the cover of the ringing-box and examined
the connections. Replacing this cover, he
rose with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said to Stockbridge, who was
standing with his back turned. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right
here, sir. I don&#8217;t find a thing. See&mdash;it&#8217;s all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble-hunter lifted the receiver from
the hook. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said in a low voice.
&#8220;Hello, Saidee. Say, Saidee, what number is
this on your board?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lineman glanced around the room. His
eyes widened. He whistled with naïve admiration.
&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;Yes ... Gramercy
Hill 9763. That&#8217;s right. O.K. Tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>Franklin Official&mdash;tell Tupper that I took forty
minutes on the job. Forty minutes at time and
a half. Don&#8217;t forget that. Yes ... bridle&mdash;everything,
all right, Saidee. See you later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble-hunter reached for his satchel.
He hitched it over his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;What <i>was</i> the
trouble? Why couldn&#8217;t we get Central?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can search me&mdash;sir. It wasn&#8217;t in this
room, mister. That&#8217;s a Western-Union cinch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the junction-box in the alley?
Could it have been there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well it could&mdash;come to think of it. I scraped
an&#8217; cleaned th&#8217; connections to make sure.
They&#8217;re all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anybody about?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lineman hitched up the satchel and
scratched his ear. &#8220;Seems to me, I did. A fellow
climbed over the fence from the back yard
of this house just as I swings in from the side
street. It was snowin&#8217; a bit an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t see
very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of looking fellow?&#8221; snapped
Drew with awakened interest. &#8220;German?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You took th&#8217; very words right out of my
mouth,&#8221; said the trouble-hunter. &#8220;He looked
like a German.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Describe him! Tall, fat or small?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t near enough to notice for sure.
Tall, I think. He went out the alley and turned
toward Fifth Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could he have called us up from that junction-box?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;if he had a set of testers like this.&#8221;
The lineman tapped his shirt with his left hand.
&#8220;He could have talked with you, but he couldn&#8217;t
ring your bell without a magneto or an alternating
current of some kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could he have cut the wires and connected
them again without Central noticing anything
out of the ordinary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might. But who would do that, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all!&#8221; said Drew in dismissal.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a dollar. Keep still about your visit
here. We may want you later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want you later,&#8221; repeated the magpie.</p>

<p>Drew turned toward Stockbridge as the lineman
shuffled through the portières. &#8220;Queer,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Tall fellow, eh! That&#8217;s the man who
cut in and threatened you. We&#8217;ll get him! I&#8217;ll
go out and see if Delaney has arrived. Two
hours of the twelve have passed. Ten more
should see you safely out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>CHAPTER THREE</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE MAN IN OLIVE-DRAB&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Triggy Drew stood on the marble steps
of the Stockbridge mansion. The butler
had just helped him on with his coat. The
door had closed softly. The outer air gripped
with cold that crackled. A soft snow was falling
upon the city. It blurred the view of the
Avenue, as seen to north and south. It wound
the opposite buildings with a shroud of winter.</p>

<p>The detective squared his shoulders, thrust
his hands in his pockets for warmth, and hurried
out between the iron-grilled gates, which
stood slightly ajar. He hesitated a moment on
the sidewalk. Again he glanced up and down
the Avenue. The soft purring of a motor
sounded. A taxi churned through the snow. It
came to a slow stop at the opposite curb. The
glow from an overhead arc showed that this
taxi was crammed black with men.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Delaney and his squad,&#8221; said the
detective turning up his collar. &#8220;He&#8217;s late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew crossed the Avenue on a long diagonal.
He eyed the alert chauffeur. He rounded the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>taxi and jerked open its door. The orders he
whispered to the squad of operatives were terse
and to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep Stockbridge&#8217;s block covered,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Watch all four corners. Two of you get into
the alley, back of the house, and climb the fence.
Keep your eyes on the junction-box and the
telephone wires. Don&#8217;t let anybody touch them.
All out, now. It&#8217;s a big job with double-pay,
men!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cramped operatives climbed out and
stood on the sidewalk. They glanced from Drew
to the towering spires of the Stockbridge mansion.
Their eyes grew hard with calculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s big,&#8221; repeated Drew. &#8220;You know
who lives there? He&#8217;s been threatened twice.
Somebody gave him twelve hours to live. Two
of the twelve are gone. It&#8217;s up to us to see
that nothing happens in the next ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney touched his hat. &#8220;All right, Chief,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;ll answer for the boys
I brought. I&#8217;ll get rid of this taxi.&#8221; The operative
turned toward the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it around the corner on the side
street,&#8221; Drew ordered. &#8220;Have him turn and
head this way. We can&#8217;t tell what minute we
will need him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney gave the order. He paired off the
operatives and sent them hurrying through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>snow. Drew noticed that he had brought six
men for the assignment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; he said as the last operative disappeared.
&#8220;Six is better than five. This thing
is widening out. I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if we needed
more, before the night passes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s coming off?&#8221; asked Delaney with
an Irish grin. &#8220;Another stock scandal like the
Flying Boat one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An echo of it&mdash;perhaps,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;It&#8217;s
dog eat dog, I guess. Stockbridge is no saint.
Some man with a whispering&mdash;consumptive
voice has &#8217;phoned him the news that he was
going to die before daylight. I don&#8217;t think he
is. Not if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did he rob this time&mdash;the old devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s retired. It&#8217;s a case, perhaps, of thieves
falling out in high places. Remember how
Stockbridge beat Morphy to the District Attorney
and told all he knew, and went before the
Grand Jury? Morphy may be behind this
threat-by-wire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphy&#8217;s behind bars, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that. He&#8217;s always dangerous,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another old devil,&#8221; said Delaney thrashing
his arms. &#8220;I can see him now, Chief, in his
big automobile. A husky man with a leather
coat and cap. And always a woman by his side,
Chief. A different woman, every time!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>&#8220;He fell a long way, Delaney. Come on.
We&#8217;ll forget Morphy for a while. Stockbridge
is alone. He is in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew clutched the operative&#8217;s arm and motioned
across the street. They plunged through
the snow with heads down. They entered the
iron-grilled gate. Drew touched a button set
in the stone of the doorway. He repeated the
signal.</p>

<p>The door opened to a crack. A chain rattled.
A face blotted out the inner light of the mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;All right, butler.
This is one of my operatives. Let us in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler led the way through the hall of
old masters, after taking the detectives&#8217; coats
and hats. He parted the curtains and announced
the operatives. Drew pressed Delaney into the
library.</p>

<p>Stockbridge sat in the same position between
the tables. The rose-light from the ornate lamp
brought out deep lines which transversed his
yellow face. Fear gave way to a mumbling satisfaction
as he stared at the two resolute detectives
who had come to guard him. He rested
his eyes upon Delaney. His brows raised in
inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Delaney,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;He&#8217;s the
man who brought back Morphy from Hartford.
He&#8217;s true blue. Delaney, this is your case as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>well as mine. Your old prisoner may be involved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphy ain&#8217;t in it, Chief. He&#8217;s locked up
tighter than the Sub-Treasury&#8217;s strong-box.
It&#8217;s some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you get on the telephone call?
The call I had you trace through Spencer Ott,
the Chief Electrician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, as yet! I waited. That&#8217;s what
kept me so long.&#8221; Delaney glanced at his
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll &#8217;phone later, I guess,&#8221; said Drew.
&#8220;Now,&#8221; he added turning toward Stockbridge.
&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s cover everything in this house.
What time was it, Delaney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine forty-eight, when I looked, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s early. Suppose you allow a half
hour for a search of the upper house. Take
that time and go over everything. Pay particular
attention to Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s rooms. Look
at the windows. See that they are locked. See
that there are no places where a man could be
hidden. You&#8217;ll permit Delaney to do this, Mr.
Stockbridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Munition Magnate nodded. He kept his
eyes on Drew, who still faced him. &#8220;Do you
think it is necessary?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer
for my servants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must suspect everybody,&#8221; Drew said.
&#8220;Go on, Delaney. Find the butler and let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>him show you around. I&#8217;ve searched in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney started toward the portières as
Stockbridge reached down and pressed the
floor-button with his finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; said Drew with afterthought.
&#8220;You better knock on Miss Stockbridge&#8217;s
door and ask permission to go through
her suite. There&#8217;s just a chance that you might
see something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might see something!&#8221; shrilled the magpie.</p>

<p>Delaney turned with a startled half-oath.
&#8220;Wot&#8217;s that?&#8221; he asked, aggressively clenching
his huge fists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might be something!&#8221; chortled the magpie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; Drew laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s only a
magpie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a crow, Chief. It sure startled
me. I thought we had the villain right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited. Delaney&mdash;with a last glance
toward the bird-cage&mdash;followed the butler to the
upper floors of the mansion. Drew opened the
letter and studied it. He examined the postmark.
He heard, as he was replacing the paper
in the envelope, the click of the glass against
the bottle at Stockbridge&#8217;s side. There followed
a dry chuckle of inner satisfaction. A
match was struck. Cigar smoke wreathed under
the rose-light and floated toward a high
radiator which was over the book-cases. Drew
went over to these and glanced upward. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>gilt-grilled ventilator, through which the smoke
passed, was narrow and set within the wallplaster.
It showed no sign of marks at its edge.
It was the only opening, save the door and the
two great windows at the front, which led from
or into the library.</p>

<p>He returned to the center of the library. A
swishing sounded. Loris, with eyes aflame,
glided into the room. The curtains dropped
behind her with soft rustling. She glanced from
Drew to her father. She stamped her slippered
foot upon the thick pile of the rug before the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;By what right?&#8221; she said to Drew. &#8220;By
whose orders have you sent that awful man
to my rooms?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew flushed beneath the olive of his skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> sent him,&#8221; he admitted guiltily. &#8220;I never
thought you would be offended, Miss Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;greatly so! Do you mistrust me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stockbridge,&#8221; Drew hastened to say
with soft apology. &#8220;Miss Loris&mdash;that thought
never entered my mind. It never did! I&#8217;ll have
Mr. Delaney out, right away. He should not
have gone in without your permission. I told
him to knock and ask you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My maid let him in. I&mdash;I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew studied her gown. It had been changed.
The Irish lace and the lavender one had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>replaced by an Oxford-gray tailor-made suit
which fitted her slender, elegant form like a
close glove. Her slippers were topped with
fawn-hued spats. One ring was on her finger.
It was a solitaire of price. It gleamed and
flashed in the rose-light as she raised her hand
to her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have Delaney right out,&#8221; repeated
Drew, bowing and starting for the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew paused. He turned. The magnate towered
over the table. His eyes were blood-shot
and glazed with resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;No, you&#8217;ll not have
him out! Let him do his duty! Loris, go upstairs!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go&mdash;up&mdash;stairs!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flushed. Scarlet ripples rose from
her young breast. Her cheeks crimsoned into
two burning spots. She wheeled, gathered up
her skirt, and glided swiftly through the portières
which dropped behind her like a curtain
of a stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go&mdash;up&mdash;stairs,&#8221; quoted the magpie greatly
excited.</p>

<p>Drew retained the vision of Loris long after
her footsteps had ceased to sound in the hallway.
He grew thoughtful as he waited. There
were details to the case which already caused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>him concern. It was evident that the girl was
tremendously high-spirited and willful. Her
obedience to her father&#8217;s demand had only been
after a struggle with her turbulent nature. She
had given in to him, but friction was there
which might cause trouble at a future hour.</p>

<p>Delaney parted the portières, finally. He
strode into the library with a flushed face. He
lifted one brow as he jerked his head upward
in a mute signal to Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s all O. K.,&#8221; he blurted swinging
toward Stockbridge and eyeing the bottle beside
the telephone. &#8220;O. K. upstairs. I searched
most everything&mdash;posted a valet at the master&#8217;s
suite and took a look into Miss Stockbridge&#8217;s
rooms. They seem all right. I guess they&#8217;re
all right,&#8221; he added with candor, which Drew
understood referred to the girl and her outburst
in her boudoir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Drew said closing his lips. &#8220;That&#8217;s
good. Now, Mr. Stockbridge,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;there will be eight of us on the outside of
this house. You have your trusted servants
inside. There&#8217;s three telephones in good order,
thanks to the trouble-man. There&#8217;s the entire
New York Police and Detective Departments to
back us up. There should be no trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Magnate blinked beneath the cone of
rose-light. He wet his dry lips. He rubbed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>scaly hands. &#8220;Any orders to me?&#8221; he asked
determinedly. &#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lock this library door when Delaney
and I go out. Lock it and bolt it securely.
Don&#8217;t take a particle of food. Don&#8217;t drink any
water. Try to get along to-night without sampling
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stockbridge reached for the bottle of Bourbon.
He held it up to the light. It was half
full. &#8220;All right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I might finish
part of this&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at Delaney. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be all
right,&#8221; he said turning. &#8220;That bottle&#8217;s been
tested. You might let this officer try a little of
it. Nothing like being sure, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney was willing. The drink he poured,
after the butler brought a clean glass, would
have cost him considerable money in war time.
He upended it neat. He smiled as one hand
rested upon his chest. &#8220;Fine!&#8221; he said with
sincerity. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; th&#8217; matter with
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned toward the portières, where, between,
the butler waited. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Remember&mdash;lock and bolt this door. Instruct
your man to stay outside and not to leave
it under any circumstances. When you go up
to your bedroom, have him go with you. Then
lock the upstairs door and let your valet sleep
across the threshold. You can have a mattress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>moved for that purpose. I&#8217;ll come in&mdash;first
thing in the morning. Good night, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night,&#8221; repeated Stockbridge rising
from his chair and leaning his hands upon the
polished surface of the table. &#8220;Good night to
both of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced back as the butler pressed in
the curtains and started closing the hardwood
door. The Magnate still stood erect under the
rich glow from the overhead cone. His eyes
were slit-lidded and defiant. He glared about
the room like an aged lion in a jungle-glade. He
started around the table.</p>

<p>The door closed. Drew waited in the hallway.
He heard the lock snap. The bolt shot
home. Stockbridge was alone in a sealed room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch this door!&#8221; ordered Drew clutching
the butler&#8217;s purple sleeve. &#8220;Watch it like a
cat. Stay right near it under any and all circumstances.
Don&#8217;t go away from it. It may
mean life or death to your master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stoiy right &#8217;ere, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that you do,&#8221; cautioned the Detective.
&#8220;See that you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney found the hats and coats in the
foyer. These they donned, opened the outer
door, and stepped into the night with jaws
squared and hands thrust deep in their pockets.</p>

<p>They crossed the snow-mantled Avenue upon
a long diagonal which brought them to the up-town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>corner and the waiting taxi, whose engine
was softly purring beneath its hooded bonnet.</p>

<p>The driver was asleep. He woke as Drew
laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen anything?&#8221; asked the Detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;, boss, but snow. Nothin&#8217; at all,&#8221;
he yawned.</p>

<p>Delaney glanced about. He opened the taxi
door on the street side and lunged inward with
a sigh of relief. Drew followed and pulled the
door shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the bunch?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Just how
did you post them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flood&#8217;s with the fixed-post cop on the Avenue.
He&#8217;s down a block. Flynn and Cassady
are in the alley&mdash;in the yard, I mean. They&#8217;re
watching the junction-box and the wires. Joe
and O&#8217;Toole went east. Harrigan is planted
across the street. That&#8217;s him between the two
buildings. See him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rubbed the rear glass of the taxi. He
pressed his nose against this. A blurred form,
almost obliterated by falling snow, showed
where the operative was guarding the mansion.</p>

<p>Delaney, who was watching out through another
window, suddenly clutched Drew by the
arm. &#8220;Look!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Look, Chief!
Over toward the big house!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Detective drew back from his study of
Harrigan. He turned on the seat and followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>Delaney&#8217;s pointing finger. He clamped his jaw
shut with a click of strong teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s coming out of Stockbridge&#8217;s,&#8221;
said the operative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quek!&#8221; signaled Drew. &#8220;Watch, closely,&#8221;
he added in a whisper.</p>

<p>A girl came through the doorway and opened
the iron-grilled gates. She paused and glanced
north and south through the curtain of down-falling
snow. She turned with resolution and
hurried along the east side of the Avenue. She
was at the corner opposite the taxi, when Drew
reached and opened the door with sly fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tail her,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Right after her,
Delaney. I&#8217;d know that little lady in a million.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loris Stockbridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Right after her! There&mdash;she turned
east. See her white spats? See her furs?
Some queen to be out a night like this. Don&#8217;t
let her get too far ahead of you. That&#8217;s right,
Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative sprang to the curb. He rounded
the hood of the taxi. He slouched along
the pavement to the corner, waited for the fraction
of a minute until a limousine passed, then
hurried over the Avenue. He disappeared into
the canyon whose walls were towering apartments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>and whose end was marked by a row
of soft arcs across which, snow falling from
housetops, sparkled in the night like diamonds
beyond price.</p>

<p>The Avenue churned with returning theater-parties
and night-hawk cabs. The roar of the
city came to the waiting Detective&#8217;s ears like
a giant turning in his first sleep. The sifting
snow sanded against the windows of the taxi.
The purring motor missed sparking now and
then. It shook the cab as it resumed its revolving
with a sputter and a cough in the muffler.
The driver huddled deeper in his sheep-skin
coat collar. He snored in synchronism with the
engine.</p>

<p>Drew rubbed the glass before him and studied
the aspect with close-lidded intentness. He
marked the shut gates of the Mansion down the
Avenue. He saw that the lights from the inner
globes had been extinguished. He counted the
staring windows. His eyes lowered to the soft
rose-glow which streamed out through the shut
blinds of the library. Snow was on the slats
and sills.</p>

<p>A swift crunch of heavy shoes at the side of
the taxi&mdash;the turning of the door-lock&mdash;the
burly form in black that climbed in, announced
Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Chief!&#8221; he said somewhat out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>breath. &#8220;All right&mdash;move over. Here she
comes back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rubbed a frosted pane with his elbow.
A blurred form&mdash;close to the sheltering wall of
the side street&mdash;revealed itself into Loris
Stockbridge. She turned the corner. She
glanced back over her sabled shoulder. She
pressed her gloved hands deep within her muff
and almost ran for the iron-grilled gates of the
mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;She connected with a blonde lad in olive-drab
uniform!&#8221; said Delaney. &#8220;He gave her
something that looked to me like a revolver.
Wot d&#8217;ye make out-a that, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE MURDER&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Triggy Drew had no good answer for
Delaney&#8217;s question concerning the revolver.
The matter was important in
view of the threat aimed toward Stockbridge.
Why Loris should obtain a gun from a rendezvous
in a drug-store was more than the Detective
could fathom. He turned to Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Explain yourself!&#8221; he snapped, gripping
the operative by the sleeve. &#8220;Make yourself
clear! We have no time to waste in this matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney gulped and whispered. &#8220;It&#8217;s this
way. I follows the girl until she turns around
the corner where there is an all-night drug-store.
She was in a telephone-booth when I
came up and looked through the window. She
was trying to get a number. While she&#8217;s trying,
a taxi rushes up and out jumps a lad in a
long benny. He pays the driver with a bill and
hurries past me and into the drug-store. I gets
a good look at him. He&#8217;s about twenty-three
years old, blonde hair and tall<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;Tall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was five feet eleven, Chief. I&#8217;d say that
to be safe. The uniform he wore under the
benny was olive-drab with bars on his shoulder.
He took the overcoat off&mdash;afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many bars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; exclaimed Drew with sudden
vigor. &#8220;Good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl,&#8221; went on Delaney, &#8220;was &#8217;phoning
for him. She dropped the receiver when she
heard him come in. She had the party she
wanted&mdash;right there. Good deduction&mdash;that
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Detective snorted. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said
with a faint frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it was! Well, I moves over and starts
puttin&#8217; a penny in the slot-machine outside the
drug-store. The machine didn&#8217;t work very
well on account of the snow. I&#8217;m a long time
gettin&#8217; my piece of chewin&#8217;-gum. I sees them
talking in the drug-store. His coat is off &#8217;cause
it&#8217;s warm inside. He had an officer&#8217;s uniform
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One bar or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two bars on his shoulder, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, then. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a tall lad with thick lips and wide-blue
eyes. He&#8217;s straight as a pike-staff and good
lookin&#8217;&mdash;for a blonde.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;Looks German?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so I could notice! Seemed to be a bit
of a swell. Had gloves and a high-class wrist
watch. I hate them things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew smiled. &#8220;Hurry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
take too long. What happened? What about
the smoke-wagon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m comin&#8217; to it, Chief. They moves over
to the drug-case. They chins some more. Then
he blows her to a soda&mdash;a cherry sundae.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rubbed the glass at his side and started
out. He swept the mansion with swift-running
eyes. He turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were sweet&mdash;them two,&#8221; went on Delaney
with thought. &#8220;I deducts they&#8217;d known
each other a long while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit your deducting. Get to facts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Chief, he ups and gives the drug-store
the once over with sharp looks. Then he handed
her a little, flat box which she pops into her
muff&mdash;quick as any shop-hister. It was as
quick as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it was a revolver?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By what followed, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What followed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her hand creeps into the muff. It works
around while the clerk is mixin&#8217; the sundae.
When the clerk&#8217;s back is turned, out comes the
hilt of a nice, little gat with ivory trimmin&#8217;s.
It&#8217;s one of them lovely watch-charm affairs&mdash;all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>polished up without a knock-out punch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A twenty-two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that. It&#8217;s the caliber them actresses
carry in their stockings. It might kill, though,
at short range.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Delaney. Tell me what happened
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gets my chewin&#8217;-gum, Chief. I backs to
the curb. They finish their sundae. I&#8217;m across
the street when the lad goose-steps out of the
drug-store&mdash;alone. O&#8217;Toole was talking with
the fixed-post cop and a Central Office man
half-way down the block. They gets my office
when I pulls out my handkerchief. The C. O.
dick covers the corner. O&#8217;Toole falls in behind
the lad in the fur benny as he passes him, with
collar turned up and leggins working at a double-time
through the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good! O&#8217;Toole will put him to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. Leave it to O&#8217;Toole. He never
lost a tail yet. He&#8217;ll follow that lad to France&mdash;unless you
call him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew polished the glass and strained his eyes
in the direction of Stockbridge&#8217;s mansion. The
Avenue had quieted over the hour after midnight.
A few belated pedestrians, muffled to the
brows, glanced at the waiting taxi with curiosity.
They did not stop, however.</p>

<p>Delaney drew out his watch and studied its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>dial by aid of the light which streamed from a
corner arc. He replaced the watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve-forty-five,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Wish
I&#8217;d brought a pint along. I would have, if the
dame hadn&#8217;t come out of the drug-store so
quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she buy anything&mdash;or do anything,
after the officer left her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Just waited a second, then came sailin&#8217;
out without a smile. Had her hands crammed
in her muff. That&#8217;s where the revolver was.
Bet it was loaded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More deduction,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Don&#8217;t jump
at conclusions, Delaney. Get facts and work
from them. Get<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Detective&#8217;s voice trailed into silence. He
reached swiftly and wiped his hand over the
frosted pane. He pressed his nose against the
glass until it became white with cold. He
jerked back his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quek!&#8221; he signaled from deep down in his
throat. &#8220;Quek, Delaney! Open the door.
Somebody is coming out of the house!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney twisted the handle. A breath of
stinging air swept into the taxi&#8217;s heated space.
Snow followed and drifted across the detectives&#8217;
knees. Both men strained in one position.
Their eyes burned as they waited with
grim-set lips.</p>

<p>A light shone from the lower entrance of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>mansion. Its oblong brought out in bold-relief
the details of the iron-grilled gates. Across
this fine snow sifted. A man emerged. He
closed the door. He opened the gates and staggered
toward the Avenue&#8217;s curb. He stood,
bare-headed in the night. His chin swung
north and south with helpless motion. He fixed
his eyes upon the waiting taxi, with a start of
recognition. He came over the surface of the
Avenue with faltering, bewildered steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;The butler!&#8221; snapped Drew. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Stockbridge&#8217;s butler! What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God only knows!&#8221; exclaimed Delaney.</p>

<p>Drew climbed over the operative and sprang
to the curb. He charged around the rear of the
taxi and brought up with a jerk before the
startled servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The butler stammered an incoherent answer.
His eyes wavered from the taxi to the mansion&mdash;then back again.
They gripped to a dead-lock
with the detective&#8217;s own.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; exclaimed Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. I don&#8217;t know<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool! Answer me!&#8221; The Detective
clutched the butler&#8217;s shoulder with a vise-grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What happened?
What is the matter&mdash;over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of that! Answer! Answer!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>&#8220;The telephone company, sir. The telephone
people rang me ... they rang me hup hon the
downstairs &#8217;phone, sir. They said ... she
said ... the chief-loidy said for me to &#8217;ang the
receiver hup hon the Gramercy &#8217;ill &#8217;ook, sir.
The 9763 one, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one is that&mdash;the library?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It his, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on! Go on! Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I goes back where I &#8217;ad left the second-man,
sir, by the door, sir, as you&#8217;d ordered, sir. I
knocks &#8217;ard on the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes!&#8221; said Drew, feeling Delaney&#8217;s
hot breath over his shoulder. &#8220;Yes! Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knocks, sir. I pounds &#8217;ard. I &#8217;ammers
and &#8217;ammers hon the wood, sir. &#8217;E don&#8217;t answer&mdash;&#8217;e
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew&#8217;s face grew stern. &#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked
still holding the butler&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Well&mdash;what
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knocks some &#8217;arder. Then the second-man,
&#8217;e knocks. &#8217;E &#8217;its the door with &#8217;is &#8217;eel,
sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Drew, turning and clasping
Delaney&#8217;s sleeve. &#8220;Come on&mdash;something <i>is</i>
wrong!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective swept the Avenue with a sharp
glance as he hurried across the wheel-churned
ice and snow. He signaled to Harrigan by
drawing a handkerchief. That operative detached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>himself from the shadow between the
two houses and moved toward the corner. He
stood there on guard as Drew hurried through
the iron-grilled gates and thrust his knee
against the door. It opened. Delaney and the
butler crowded in. They mounted the inner
stairs on tiptoes. Drew&#8217;s hand went behind
him in warning. He turned at the top of the
landing. The second-man was standing before
the library door with folded arms and a watchdog
expression on his cockney face. He remained
in that position as Drew glided to his
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear anything?&#8221; asked the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never a word, sir. Hit&#8217;s blym quiet hin
there. Hi think &#8217;e&#8217;s &#8217;ad something &#8217;appen, sir.
&#8217;E never acted like that&mdash;before, sir. Sometimes
&#8217;e sleeps, but &#8217;e always wakes hup when
the walley comes after &#8217;im, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E does,&#8221; echoed the butler with chattering
teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you tried to unlock this
door?&#8221; queried Drew, twisting the knob.
&#8220;Have you tried the outer lock? You might
have shot the bolt in your excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The key to the houter lock, sir, is hinside!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; snapped Drew, pressing against the
panel as he listened close up to the chamfering.
&#8220;It is, eh? That&#8217;s funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E put hit there, sir. The master did, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>Drew did not dwell further on this. He
stared at Delaney, with unseeing eyes. He bent
and listened for a second time. He stiffened
suddenly. He jerked back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he whispered tersely. &#8220;Everybody
listen. What&#8217;s that noise inside? Hear
it? Hear it, Delaney?&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative dropped to his knees and
pressed his ear to a faint line of light below the
door. He rose, dusting his knees. He swore
audibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like the crow, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stockbridge&#8217;s magpie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Detective laid his ear flat against the key-hole.
His face hardened as he waited. He lifted
his head and pointed with a steady finger.
&#8220;Listen!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;There&mdash;listen.
That&#8217;s no magpie!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>A low whine like the howl of a wild thing rose
to a reed note of moribund terror. It died; then
resumed its shrieking. It leaped the octaves
from no note to a blare of a soul in agony. Suddenly
it struck down the tone scale with descending
steps of mocking laughter.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; shouted Drew, bending his knees
and gliding back to the wall of the hallway.
&#8220;Look out!&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>&#8220;What are you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221; asked Delaney
huskily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? I&#8217;m going to break the door down!
Look out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective braced himself against the wall.
He lunged forward and crashed against the dark
panel near the lock and bolt, with the energy of
a college fullback. He backed away and repeated
the smashing blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Chief,&#8221; Delaney said. &#8220;That&#8217;s no
use. The door is two inches thick. I had a good
look at it. Wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rubbed his right shoulder as Delaney
turned toward the white-faced butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get an ax!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Beat it, and
get a big ax, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The axes are in the furnace room, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get one! Bring it right up, you. Hurry
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative turned toward Drew. &#8220;The
only way, Chief,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in
too many of Big Bill Devery&#8217;s raids not to
know how to break down a strong door. I&#8217;m
the man who took Honest John Kelsey&#8217;s house
apart for him. It was built like a British tank.&#8221;</p>

<p>The puffing butler appeared with a fire ax.
He handed it to Delaney, who eyed the edge with
concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not sharp,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;ll do, at a
pinch. Look out&mdash;everybody!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>Delaney waved the servants away. He
moistened his broad palms. He swung the ax
and crashed its weight into the panel nearest the
lock. He followed this blow with another. He
panted as he rained swinging slashes at the dark
wood. It splintered. An opening was made.
This opening was enlarged by short-arm jabs
until Drew laid a hand on Delaney&#8217;s shoulder
and called a halt. &#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he said bending
down.</p>

<p>He straightened. He enlarged the chopped
place with his fingers. He ripped off the
splinters until there was room for a palm to be
inserted. Delaney, dropping the ax upon the
hall-rug, thrust through his arm to the elbow.
He bent his knee as he strained. His face
screwed into a knot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the key there?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye&mdash;s. I turned it. All the way, Chief.
Here&#8217;s the bolt. Both were locked tight. Both
locked, on the inside of the library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember that!&#8221; snapped Drew, squaring
his shoulders. &#8220;Everybody remember that. It
may be important!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew pressed Delaney aside. He seized the
gold knob and turned it slowly. He waited for
a moment. Nothing sounded save the loud
breathing of the butler and the other servants
who were crowded in the hall.</p>

<p>The detective jerked open the splintered door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>He hesitated and listened. He pressed aside the
portières with his left hand as his right fingers
coiled over the ugly hilt of a police regulation
.44. He advanced into the library, foot by foot.
His fingers still coiled the gun&#8217;s butt. He stood
rigid as he reached the fringe of the splendid
rug which was under the great table. His
sweeping, close-lidded eyes took in the details
of the room. He saw the magpie in its cage.
The bird&#8217;s feathers were ruffled. Its head
darted in and out the bars with great excitement.</p>

<p>Drew frowned as he noticed a wreath of pale-blue
smoke curling under the dome of the rose-light.
He sniffed the air with a shrewd intake.
A powder explosion of some kind had left a
trace. The air, so close and warm, was filled
with acrid menace.</p>

<p>The detective removed his hand from the revolver&#8217;s
butt and waved it behind him as a signal
to Delaney and the servants to stay where
they were. He took one step forward. The
white writing paper and envelope from the cemetery
company were upon the table. The stump
of a half-smoked cigar draped over this table&#8217;s
edge like a gun on a parapet. It was cold and
without ash.</p>

<p>The smaller of the two tables was overturned.
The whisky bottle and glass lay at the edge of
the rug nearest the wall. The telephone transmitter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>and receiver were upon the hardwood
floor, where they had fallen with the butts of
two Havana cigars and the ash trays and match
boxes.</p>

<p>Stockbridge was crumpled into a twisted knot
against the rich wainscoting. His head was half
under his left shoulder. His iron-gray hair was
singed black over the left ear.</p>

<p>Drew leaned with one hand on the corner of
the table and peered downward. He called the
magnate&#8217;s name. He repeated it. He turned
toward the doorway. His hand raised. His
finger pressed against his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stockbridge is dead,&#8221; he told Delaney, who
glided to his side. &#8220;He is dead. He was shot
to death in this sealed room. I wonder who
did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sing!&#8221; shrieked the magpie. &#8220;Ah,
Sing! Ah, Sing!&#8221;</p>

<div>
<a id='ch05'></a>
<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE FIRST CLEWS&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The magpie&#8217;s words, repeated over and
over as Drew and Delaney stood in the
room of death, struck both men as a possible
clew. It was more than likely that the
murderer or the murdered man had shouted
something, the moment the shot was fired. This
exclamation might have been, &#8220;Ah, Sing!&#8221;
The bird had repeated something it had memorized,
or retained in its shallow brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sing!&#8221; suggested Drew, keenly on the
alert. &#8220;Ah, Sing, eh? Never forget that! We
may need it&mdash;later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like a Chinaman,&#8221; said the operative.
&#8220;Stockbridge was shot by a Chink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get busy! Go over the room and look for a
possible hiding place. You, butler, stand across
that doorway! Don&#8217;t move from there!&#8221; Drew
wheeled and stared at the white faces of the
servants which were framed in the somber curtains
of the opening to the hall.</p>

<p>The detective swung back. He rounded the
large table with slow steps. He bent down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>One knee touched the rug. He reached and
grasped the magnate&#8217;s stiff arm. He worked
it like a hinge. He felt of the muscles. They
were rigid.</p>

<p>Rising, Drew again tested the air of the library.
He glanced at Delaney, who was opening
the book-case doors.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you smell?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The operative turned and sniffed with widening
nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s powder!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gunpowder,
Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind-a peculiar&mdash;at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Explain yourself&mdash;be clear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney scratched his head. &#8220;I&#8217;d say, Chief,
it was smokeless powder. It don&#8217;t smell like
the ordinary kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw smoke when I came in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That smokeless stuff smokes. It ain&#8217;t altogether
what they call it. Remember the shootin&#8217;-gallery
at Headquarters? There&#8217;s smoke
there when the police are practicing with them
steel-jacketed bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Keep on looking
about. I&#8217;m getting on. Stockbridge was
shot at very close range behind and under the
left ear. The weapon used was a small-caliber
revolver. The bullet is undoubtedly lodged in
the lower brain. Powder stains are in his hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>The opening is clotted shut. He fell forward.
In falling he knocked over the little table with
its load of ash-trays, match-boxes, telephone,
cigar butts and the whisky bottle and the glass.
He&#8217;s been dead some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;e&#8217;rd no shot!&#8221; cried the butler from the
doorway.</p>

<p>Drew wheeled. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said
sharply. &#8220;Delaney,&#8221; he added, &#8220;say, Delaney,
get out your note book and pencil. I
want to put down everything we can think of
before I send for the coroner. We&#8217;ll take a
complete record. This thing is diabolical. You
see nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; echoed Delaney as he slammed a
book-case door shut, dusted his fingers and
reached in his pocket. &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody planted
in this room&mdash;that&#8217;s a fact, Chief. That&#8217;s what
gets me. How was the murder done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speculation is useless&mdash;now! Get ready for
notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective strode across the library rugs
and snapped on the wall switch by jabbing at a
mother-of-pearl button. Each time he jabbed,
more lights came on. The room flooded with
soft glowing from concealed globes. This glow
brought out the full details of the palatial interior.
Drew chewed at his mustache thoughtfully.
He measured the walls with his eyes. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>glided swiftly toward the windows. He thrust
aside the heavy curtains of one and glanced upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Closed and locked,&#8221; he said to Delaney.
&#8220;Put that down. There&#8217;s snow on the sill which
has drifted through the outer slats. Put that
down. No sign of footprints. Put that down.
Now, the upper part!&#8221;</p>

<p>He climbed up on the ornate radiator box.
His fingers went over the catch. &#8220;Locked
here!&#8221; he said, glancing down. &#8220;Locked and
the same as it was. Make a note of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang down and examined the other window.
He went over the sill and the catch with
absorbed intentness. His teeth bit against his
upper lip. He shook his head as he turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance for a bullet to have been fired
through these windows!&#8221; he declared positively.
&#8220;No chance at all. This end of the library is
sealed as far as we are concerned. Now, we&#8217;ll
consider the only other opening&mdash;the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Double locks, Delaney,&#8221; he called over his
shoulder as he crossed the room and pressed
the butler back into the hall. &#8220;Double locks of
the superior order. Gold knobs and key-holes.
The holes are not in line. The chamfering is
clean, except where you struck it once or twice
with the ax. No sign of outside tampering or
jimmy work. I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ve covered this door.
Any suggestions?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>Delaney tried both the inner lock and the bolt
which was actuated with a gold butterfly-wing
of heavy construction. He studied the flat key.
It was gold-plated. He dropped to his knees
and went over the entire lower chamfering with
his broad finger.</p>

<p>He said, &#8220;No suggestions, Chief. This was
locked twice, until we broke a hole through with
an ax. I don&#8217;t see<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a note of everything!&#8221; ordered Drew
with a sharp glance at the waiting servants.
&#8220;Make a full record of what we have found&mdash;including
your exact interpretation of the magpie&#8217;s
words. What were they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the same. Let&#8217;s look the bird over.
Perhaps it will repeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two detectives strode to the bird-cage.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send for Fosdick and the coroner,&#8221;
said Drew hastily. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hurry.
What do you make of this bird? Could it have
had anything to do with the murder?&#8221;</p>

<p>The magpie protested against this accusation.
Its feathers ruffled. Its claws clamped
over the perch. Its tail extended upward and
seemed to dart with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sid!&#8221; exclaimed Drew close up to the
gilded bars. &#8220;Ah, Sid. Ah, Sid!&#8221; he repeated
as the bird sprang to the bottom of the cage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>and set this jumping up and down at the end of
the spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;No go,&#8221; said Delaney. &#8220;This black parrot
don&#8217;t like our looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew fingered the cage. He tested the spring.
He stooped and glanced underneath. He tapped
the belfry. It was of inlaid wood. It rang
solid. &#8220;No use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is all, all
right. Let&#8217;s get to the other matters before
the clews get cold. Look everywhere for a possible
trapdoor or a secret panel. Test the
walls. Move the book-cases. Turn the pictures.
Lift up the rugs. Then put everything back
like you found it. Fosdick will be on the job
with both feet and the Homicide Squad, before
we know it. We haven&#8217;t much time.&#8221; Drew
glanced at his watch as Delaney started by moving
out one of the book-cases.</p>

<p>The detective ignored the body which lay
upon the floor near the little table. He was
holding his investigation down to outside facts,
and bringing them to bear upon the crux of
the matter. In this way, he believed, he would
secure better results. He did not want to be
blinded by an impossibility at the beginning.
His first glance at Stockbridge sufficed to assure
him that the lethal instrument which had
felled the magnate was not in evidence. The
bright light from a score of globes would reveal
any such object as a revolver or rifle. No one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>of the servants had seen anything. They still
were peering into the room like men and women
who had lost all they owned. Stockbridge, despite
his temper and sins, had been a good master
to those who served him without questioning.</p>

<p>Drew glared at his watch for a second time,
in preoccupation. He strode to the library door
and beckoned a hooked finger toward the butler
who towered over the other servants.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t obey orders.
You didn&#8217;t stay where you were told to
stay! Why did you leave this door at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217; &#8217;elp me, sir, I didn&#8217;t, Mr. Drew. If I did
it wasn&#8217;t farther than the foyer or the downstairs
steps. I took very careful pains to call
the second-man, sir, when I went after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew&#8217;s eyes smoldered with inner fire. &#8220;I
told you,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;I told you to stay by
this door and not leave it&mdash;even for a minute.
You went after the second-man, by your own
admission. You went to the foyer hall. You
went to the staircase leading down to the lower
part of the house. In other words, you didn&#8217;t
watch the door, and you lost your master
through your own foolishness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, sir, nobody could &#8217;ave gotten through
the door. Hit was locked and bolted on the hinside,
sir! I &#8217;e&#8217;rd Mr. Stockbridge do that when
you left &#8217;im! I did, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;We may have been mistaken when we
thought we heard that! Perhaps he just fumbled
with the locks, and left it unlocked.&#8221; Drew
eyed the servant&#8217;s red face with a keen-lidded
glance. He waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;That cawn&#8217;t be right, sir,&#8221; said the butler,
after thought and a wild glance about. &#8220;&#8217;Ow
can that be right? I tried the door when the
telephone loidy called me hup! I tried hit twice.
James tried hit! &#8217;E fixes hall the locks in the
&#8217;ouse, sir. &#8217;E says it was most excellently secured,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that?&#8221; asked Drew, turning to
the second-man. &#8220;What of that, James?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m a little of everythin&#8217; about
the &#8217;ouse. I tends the door and I watches the
lights and locks, sir. I was born in Brixton, sir,
where the old man kept a lock-shop, sir. That&#8217;s
twenty years, and more ago, sir. Beggin&#8217; your
pardon, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew swung upon the butler. The second-man
was the living picture of truth. His dereliction,
if any, might consist in sly tapping of
the wine-cellar. His nose attested to this habit,
in a brilliant rosette.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re partly to blame!&#8221; Drew told the
butler. &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody in this room who
could have committed the murder. There was
nobody here when we left Mr. Stockbridge.
There is no way for anybody to get in, save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>through this door. The same applies in getting
out&mdash;escaping. If you were awake and always
here, and if you were honest,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I
could presume that the master was slain by&mdash;well,
let us say, unnatural causes. Such things
do not exist. This is a material age. Nothing
as much as a pin-head or point was ever moved
save through a natural cause. No bullet could
be fired into a man&#8217;s brain without a hand which
planned or pulled the trigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler stared at Drew with blank expression.
He gulped. His eyes dropped. &#8220;I&#8217;m
thinking,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the whole blym occurrence
his unnatural. I never left that door
until they told me the telephone company&#8217;s loidy
wanted me on the wire. It was then I left it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting there.
Then, if you are speaking truth, and I won&#8217;t
help you if you are not, we have reached a point
in the case which will bear considerable thought.
It is evident that Stockbridge was murdered by
a pistol shot, at or about the time the table
and contents were spilled over. In other words,
the shot which bowled him over brought down
with it the telephone transmitter and receiver.
That is the thing which fixes, within minutes&mdash;perhaps
seconds&mdash;the time of the murder. The
telephone girl will have a record which will help
us considerable. Many criminals have been
caught&mdash;and convicted by the time element.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>There is no alibi against truth! A man can&#8217;t
be in two places at the same time!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned toward the door. He hesitated
and wheeled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard nothing fall in this room?&#8221; he
asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cawn&#8217;t say that I did, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No telephone bell ringing? Ringing at any
time after I left the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not downstairs, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ow, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me the telephone company
rang up and wanted you to put the receiver on
the hook in the library?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t &#8217;ear it ring. James brought the
word, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, what happened upstairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ow do you know, sir? &#8217;Ow&#8217;d you know it
rang up there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By elimination! It rang then, in Loris&#8217;
room? You said &#8216;nothing downstairs&#8217; in such
a way I presume it rang upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler stroked his chin. It was blue and
close-shaved. The purple of his cheeks and
neck had deepened. He glanced about the hallway.
His eyes wandered toward the grand
stairway which, coiled upward to the second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>story. &#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;iding nothing, sir,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Miss Loris often is called up at night. She&#8217;s
very popular, sir. I &#8217;e&#8217;rd &#8217;er telephone ringing
once or twice while I was standing by this door,
waiting for the master to come out&mdash;which &#8217;e
never did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew hesitated. He plucked out his watch
and glanced at the dial. He turned swiftly.
&#8220;Stay right there,&#8221; he said as he parted the
portières and faced Delaney who wore the puzzled
expression of a man baffled and entirely
at sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you find?&#8221; he snapped to the operative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing, Chief.&#8221; Delaney mopped his
brow with his sleeve. &#8220;Nothing at all!&#8221; he
added. &#8220;Everything regular. Modern&mdash;very
modern house! Thick, new, fireproof, soundproof,
million-dollar building. No trapdoors or
panels. No loose boards. No hole in the ceiling.
No nothing to hang a ghost on. The gunman
who shot Stockbridge went right up in blue
smoke, Chief. I quit!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glided around the table and kneeled by
the magnate&#8217;s body. His swift, light-fingered
touch went through the trousers and vest. The
pockets he turned inside out. The watch attracted
his attention. Its dial had been cracked
by the fall. A splinter of glass pressed against
the minute hand. He rose with a low cry. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>pressed the repeater and listened to the time
chimes. He counted the strokes. He had a test
in a million. Had the watch been tampered
with by the murderer, the chimes would have
proved a lie. It was possible to set the hands to
any position. It would be difficult to change
both the hands and the repeater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney!&#8221; he said with his dark eyes glowing,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got the exact time of the murder.
As I told the butler&mdash;it is very important. Both,
chimes and hands, show that Stockbridge was
shot at four minutes and eighteen seconds past
midnight&mdash;this morning! This is a fine watch.
It cost several thousand dollars. Robbery was
not the motive. An ordinary crook, and they&#8217;re
all ordinary&mdash;with few exceptions&mdash;would have
taken this timepiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Delaney with a quick
frown. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine, Chief, but&mdash;but how did
that exceptional&mdash;crook get into this room?
How did he get out? That&#8217;s what I want to
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew combed his fingers through his black
hair. He described a complete circle about the
library, with his eyes taking in everything, before
he faced Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; he said frankly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want to think of it, either. We&#8217;ll turn the case
over to other men for the time. Let them do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>some thinking. I believe we have secured everything
we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective dropped his glance to the telephone
receiver upon the floor at Stockbridge&#8217;s
elbow. He stooped, grasped the silk-insulated
cord, and fished it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to get Central,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This has
been off a long while. She may have sent the
trouble-man again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew worked the hook of the &#8217;phone up and
down. He was answered after a short wait.
The girl&#8217;s surprised voice at hearing life at
the end of a dead set of wires was drowned in
the detective&#8217;s request to get him, &#8220;Spring 3100&mdash;quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; said Drew as he got the
connection. &#8220;Hello! Is this Spring 3100? It
is? Who&#8217;s talking? ... Jones? This you,
Jones? ... Say, Jones, plug me in on the Fifth
Deputy Commissioner&#8217;s private house wire!... Sir? ... I don&#8217;t care! ... This is Drew
talking.... Drew! ... D&mdash;r&mdash;e&mdash;w! ... That&#8217;s right ... Drew, of Drew&#8217;s Agency!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Detective turned. He eyed Delaney who
was searching the floor about the millionaire&#8217;s
upturned shoes. He tapped the receiver against
the transmitter&#8217;s silver-plated edge. His eyes
lifted. His lips hardened as the diaphragm of
the receiver vibrated harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he answered tersely. &#8220;Hello! This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>you, Commissioner? Is this Fosdick? ... This is Drew talking.
Yes! ... Drew.... Yes! I say, Fosdick, there&#8217;s been a murder
committed at Stockbridge&#8217;s.... You know&mdash;the munitions magnate! ... The
millionaire! ... Morphy&#8217;s old partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited a moment. He dropped his eyes
upon the body below him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; he continued into the transmitter.
&#8220;Yes, Fosdick. I hear better, now. Yes&mdash;Stockbridge
is dead! ... He&#8217;s stone dead! He
was shot down in cold blood! ... Yes! ... Shot in the brain.... Yes! Send your best
operatives.... Yes! ... Send a fingerprint
man and photographer. You&#8217;ll need &#8217;em! ... Yes! ... Yes! ... Shot with a small-bore revolver,
I guess! ... Wound behind ear looks
like it! What? ... No! ... Room was bolted.... He was inside.... Butler on guard.... Windows
closed and locked! ... No! ... No! ... No! ... It wasn&#8217;t suicide. He was threatened
twice, this time!... By letter and telephone
call.... What? ... What? ... No! ... He didn&#8217;t shoot himself! ... There&#8217;s no
gun. It&#8217;s on the left side&mdash;close up! ... Hair
is singed ... flesh is powder spotted.... Burned? ... Yes.... You&#8217;ll
be right up?... Yes! ... I&#8217;ll be waiting! ... Come! ... come<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew lowered the receiver and clicked it upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>the hook of the telephone which stood on the
hardwood floor. He slowly turned toward the
open doorway of the library. The servants had
drawn back and out of sight. Delaney leaned
forward with both hands on his bent knees. A
girl&#8217;s voice had sounded in the mansion. It
came closer. The portières parted with a silken
sweep. Drew braced himself against the larger
table. His hand went back to his hip. It
dropped to his side. He stared across the flood
of light with line-drawn eyelids.</p>

<p>Loris Stockbridge, gowned in lace chiffon and
cloaked with ermine and sable, glided across the
rugs and stood framed beneath the soft, rose-light
of the central dome. Her dusk-black eyes
burned and blazed like flame through tinder
smoke as she confronted the detective.</p>

<p>Clasped in the fingers of her jewelless right
hand was a tiny, ivory-handled revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are all these people doing here?&#8221; she
asked hysterically.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch06'></a>
<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>CHAPTER SIX</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;HARRY NICHOLS&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Detective Triggy Drew flushed
slightly beneath his olive skin. He
bowed, with his keen eyes fixed upon
the little, ivory-handled revolver clutched so
tightly in Loris Stockbridge&#8217;s right hand. He
bowed for a second time. His eyes lifted and
his brows arched as he said distinctly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stockbridge, something very serious
has happened to your father. It happened in
this library. It happened this morning. Won&#8217;t
you please go back upstairs to your rooms
until I call for you. At present I am in charge
of matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Matters? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl swayed slightly. She glanced down
at the revolver as if she were unaware that it
was in her hand. Drew advanced a step in her
direction. He feared a woman and a gun more
than anything else in the world. Both were liable
to form a dangerous combination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something happened,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I&#8217;m
very sorry for you, Miss Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>&#8220;Happened!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Happened to
him? You don&#8217;t mean that letter&mdash;that telephone
call&mdash;do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris&#8217; splendid, dusky eyes, within the depths
of which high lights shone, wandered over the
polished table. They fastened upon the envelope
from the cemetery company. They fixed
where the letter lay with one corner beneath the
center piece. They lifted in thought. They
swung toward the waiting detective who had
placed himself between her and the body of her
father. She divined this movement with quick
intuition. She stepped to one side and bent
downward with a graceful movement of her
hips. She gasped and pointed a left hand finger,
which wavered and went up to her hair as her
palm pressed against the side of her head. She
started sobbing&mdash;short, throaty sobs of poignant
distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; whispered Drew holding out
a guarding arm. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t, Miss Stockbridge.
Your father is beyond this earth. You
should not have come down here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>The word came from the depths of a soul.
&#8220;Dead?&#8221; she repeated with her taper fingers
spreading across her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss,&#8221; said Drew with a catch in his
voice. &#8220;Yes, he is quite dead. He was slain in
this room by a revolver shot which struck behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>and under his left ear. No one was in the
library when he locked himself in, save himself.
No one was here when we broke the door down.
And, save his servants and you, no one was in
this house. He was<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Murdered!&#8221; Loris&#8217; voice had lifted to one
wild shriek of final conviction and grief. She
swayed. Her knees bent beneath her skirt and
bulged outwardly. She sank into a slow faint
at the detective&#8217;s feet. She pillowed her head
upon the rug. A silence followed.</p>

<p>Drew stooped, after a glance at the servants
in the doorway, thrust his body as a barrier,
and reached along Loris&#8217; white arm until his
hand closed over the barrel of the little revolver.
He untwisted her cold fingers, and
palmed the weapon under a shielding cuff. He
rose, saying to Delaney, who had hurried forward:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take charge of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. Plant it. She didn&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had it all right, but&mdash;we&#8217;ll suspend
judgment. You and the butler carry her upstairs.
Go easy. Her bedroom is on the third
floor, I think. That&#8217;s the reason she didn&#8217;t come
down sooner. Perhaps, well, I say, she didn&#8217;t
hear us breaking down the door. We are her
agents in this matter, now. Remember that,
and say nothing to anybody. I&#8217;ll do the talking.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>Drew dropped his hand into his side pocket.
It came out without the revolver but with a
handkerchief between his fingers. He mopped
his brow gracefully, then replaced the handkerchief.
The motion was a natural one.</p>

<p>He followed Delaney and the butler with their
soft burden as far as the first steps of the stairway.
He turned and strode back to the doorway
leading into the library. He faced about
in this. He eyed the servants, who lowered
their heads beneath his accusing scrutiny. Focusing
his gaze to a searching squint he tried to
single out a culprit from their midst. There
seemed to be none. Each face was terror-lined
and drawn. Each seemed to want to avoid his
direct glance. None of all of them faced him
with boldness or assurance. It was as he expected
things to be. There was no evidence
shown in the case that the servants of the Stockbridge
régime had ever threatened the master.
They were old, tried and trusted. They had
the faults of their kind. These faults only
served to strengthen Drew&#8217;s opinion that the
murderer of the magnate had struck from the
outside, without benefit of inside information.
The letter and the telephone call were foreign.
A note, pinned upon the millionaire&#8217;s pillow,
would have been more effective. Nothing had
been tried like that. This proved to Drew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>he could eliminate the servants, for the time
being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one of you is the valet?&#8221; he asked
with final resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew ran his eyes over an aged man in white
vest and tight-fitting clothes which were studded
here and there with gold-plated buttons. The
fit of the stockings&mdash;the neatness of the low
patent-leather shoes&mdash;the smartness and aloofness
of the individual, caused the detective to
smile slightly. The man was better dressed
than his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your native country is Germany?&#8221; said
Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is yet. You can&#8217;t change that part
of it. When did you come to the United
States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourteen&mdash;fifteen years ago, sir. The master
brought me from England where I was employed
by the Right Honorable Arthur Sandhurst,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are now a naturalized American?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going on thirteen years, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down to my office about noon to-morrow.
I want to speak to you then. I haven&#8217;t
time now. Be sure you bring that magpie with
you.&#8221; Drew turned and jerked his thumb toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>the front of the library. &#8220;Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all!&#8221; exclaimed the detective. &#8220;One
of you may stand by the door until Mr. Delaney
returns. The rest may go downstairs. Remember,
no talking to anybody but accredited police
officers, who will soon be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stand guard!&#8221; announced the second-man
with a pompous voice. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;ll get
by me, sir. I&#8217;ll &#8217;ave them know I&#8217;m right &#8217;ere,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew backed through the curtains as the second-man
was speaking. He dropped them behind
him and started another search, which was
done in solitude and in silence. He went over
everything in the library with the trained eyes
of an operative who had learned his profession
in many schools. He left deduction and surmise
for a later hour. He was after cold facts
which might lead to an answer to the riddle. He
held, with some slight scorn, the theory of the
armchair detective and the puzzle worked out
by retrospection. His experience had been, that
only through hard work could he expect to find
his answer. He had been credited with visiting
six hundred laundries in search of a certain
mark. He had a note book filled with his failures
to find the man he was after. The men he
had found caused him no concern whatsoever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>They had gone to prison and closed their accounts
with him.</p>

<p>He applied hard work over the minutes to the
case at hand. He went over the body of the
aged millionaire. He took scrapings of the
blood stains on the floor. He scratched up some
few atoms of dried whisky. He examined the
bottle. He searched each square inch under and
about the body. He went through Stockbridge&#8217;s
pockets and beneath his vest. He tried everything
in the way of getting facts which might
bear on the case. A tape measure furnished
certain distances which were recorded upon the
back of an envelope. His data was complete,
insofar as he had time to go. He desired to
spend at least twelve hours in the library. This
could not be. The case would be taken from
his hands within minutes. Already there was a
stir in the front part of the house. The bell had
been ringing for some time. Delaney and the
butler had hastened forward to answer it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Central Office bunch!&#8221; announced the
operative, parting the curtains and staring in at
Drew. &#8220;Here they are, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective stepped briskly out of the room
and glided through the foyer hall to the front
door. Here Delaney joined him, as steps were
heard coming up from the servants&#8217; quarters
as well as outside. It was as if a raid were in
progress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>&#8220;Brass band methods!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;You
get out, Delaney, and go to our taxi. Stay
there! I want to speak to Fosdick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door opened. A burly form blotted out
the light from the Avenue and stamped in, shaking
the snow from his overcoat. It was Fosdick&mdash;Chief
of Detectives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said cuttingly. &#8220;Hello, Drew!
What&#8217;s this you&#8217;ve been giving me over the
&#8217;phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective drew Fosdick aside and allowed
five Central Office men to stream into the hallway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and see,&#8221; he suggested into the detective&#8217;s
ear. &#8220;Go and see. I&#8217;ve left everything
just as I found it. The body is still there. The
servants have been kept in the house. Question
them. I&#8217;m off, now. &#8217;Phone me not later
than eight this morning. I&#8217;ll be at my office.
I&#8217;m acting in a private capacity. I&#8217;m protecting
Loris Stockbridge&mdash;the sole heir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Protecting!&#8221; exclaimed Fosdick. &#8220;What
d&#8217;ye mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew dropped his hand to his pocket and
crammed down the little ivory-handled revolver.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he smiled broadly. &#8220;You know what
I mean. She&#8217;s alone in this world&mdash;save for
her friends. The old man called me in the case.
I&#8217;m still in the case&mdash;remember that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosdick gulped hard. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>turning and peeling off his coat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll soon get
to the bottom of this! Case looks easy to me.
It&#8217;s suicide! That&#8217;s all it ever could be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew found his hat and coat where the butler
had hung them. He went out through the front
door without answering Fosdick. He crossed
the Avenue on a diagonal which brought him to
the waiting taxi where Delaney stood muffled
to the chin. The two men climbed upon the running-board.
The driver started up with a jerk,
from his frozen position in the snow. They
rounded the block and stopped in front of the
drug-store where Loris had met the officer.</p>

<p>The Central Office man who had taken
O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s place had little to report. O&#8217;Toole
had vanished toward the south. When last seen
he was close on the heels of the man in olive-drab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Delaney,&#8221; said Drew at this information.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll walk over to Fifth Avenue
and then downtown. The driver can pick up
our men in the alley. I want to clear my head
of this muddle. A walk will do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney fell in behind his chief. They turned
the corner. They struck through a side street
and westward. They saw ahead of them the
white expanse of untrodden snow, and beyond
this the faint blue barricade of the Palisades.</p>

<p>The hour was after three. The crisp underfooting
brought wine to their cheeks. The grip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>of winter air cleared both men&#8217;s heads like a
draught of ether. They stepped out. Their
shoulders went back. Their thoughts passed
from the case at the mansion to other things.
The night had been filled with a thousand disappointments.
Greatest of these was the stabbing
memory that they both had been picked by the
multimillionaire to protect him and save him
from his enemies. They had failed in this trust.
Their patron lay dead, and somewhere a whispering
voice chuckled over a victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifth Avenue!&#8221; announced Drew as they
reached the corner. &#8220;Now, downtown, Delaney,&#8221;
he added cheerily. &#8220;Old Kris Kringle
has nothing on us to-night. I believe we&#8217;re the
only ones out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative caught his chief&#8217;s humor, and
glanced into his face with a smile. &#8220;Whew!&#8221;
he breathed. &#8220;Whew!&#8221; he repeated from the
depths of his lungs. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad, Triggy, to get
from that damn house and that damn magpie
and that<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I!&#8221; said Drew, thrusting out his hand
and linking his elbow into the cove of Delaney&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;So am I. Fine night for the poor firm
of Drew and Company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney glanced around and over his left
shoulder. He blinked with frosty lids as he
saw the towering façades of Stockbridge&#8217;s mansion;
its turrets and towers spiraled in the winter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>sky. He drew in his lips and compressed
them. He puffed them out as he turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m deducting,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that there&#8217;s more
at the bottom of this thing than we think. Put
it down for me that the Germans are mixed up
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew walked on for a block before he answered.
He gripped the operative&#8217;s arm by
closing his own as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit deducting! It&#8217;s fatal! Get your
facts! Get all of them. The answer will come
then, without an effort. It will be the right answer
or none at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, Chief<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with you,&#8221; broke in Drew severely,
&#8220;the trouble is, that you are forcing
a conclusion to meet your own suspicions. The
Germans, with the exception of a small clique,
are behaving very well in this country at the
present time. In other words, the most of them
are good Americans and sane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That walley-sham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not even under consideration! Did
you notice him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything strike you as peculiar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N&mdash;o.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were tears in his eyes&mdash;the only ones
shed in that house for Stockbridge&mdash;outside of
the daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>Delaney gulped. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see them,&#8221; he
said frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Well, I did&mdash;and when he wasn&#8217;t expecting
me to see them. A woman is never
wholly lost who can blush, or a man who can
shed tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like good deduction,&#8221; admitted the
operative. &#8220;But then, Chief, there are a lot
of fine actors in this world. I think there has
been some in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This case, Delaney,&#8221; Drew said, &#8220;is like
many others which appear at first impossible
of solving. All things can be solved by first
principles. Give me all the facts and I&#8217;ll give
you the answer to any riddle. The answer will
come! Don&#8217;t try to write your plot until you
have words to form your story. Don&#8217;t make
the mistake of forcing an answer to father a
wish. In other words, Delaney, best of friends,
we haven&#8217;t all the facts we are going to get in
this case and therefore it is idle to attempt to
deduce who shot Stockbridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or how he was shot, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost the same thing. Both answers
will come with hard work and plenty of it. We
must keep along the main stem. Truth is a tree
with many branches. It rises from the roots
named cause, and reaches the top called effect.
It springs from motive up to crime in one
straight stem. We must trim away the branches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>and the false-work, and then we can see the
trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one I&#8217;d like to trim right now,&#8221;
said Delaney, pausing in his snow-caked stride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;That noise in the library like a cat getting
its tail twisted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can explain that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been driving me to drink, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The telephone company, Delaney, have a device
they call a howler. They cut this device
in on the wire when a receiver is left off the
hook. It is simply a high-frequency current
generated for the purpose of vibrating the receiver&#8217;s
diaphragm until somebody hears the
noise and puts the receiver back on the hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a howler, all right, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oftentimes a book or magazine gets under a
receiver and lifts it up an inch or more. This
attracts the attention of the central operator
who thinks somebody is trying to get a number.
When the situation is clear to her that the receiver
is off the hook, or that the circuit is
closed without anybody being at the receiver
end, she notifies the wire-captain or chief-operator.
It was either one or the other who put the
howler on after Stockbridge was shot and the
&#8217;phone had fallen to the floor. Is that satisfactory?
Does that explain the noise we heard
in the library before we broke down the door?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>&#8220;I see now, Chief. I thought all along it was
spirits like the rest of the job. Outside of
spirits, what is the answer to the things that
happened in that house? I know it. I deduct it,
Chief. The old man was expecting somebody
all of the time. He let this somebody into the
library when the butler wasn&#8217;t looking. Maybe
it was a woman, for all we know. Maybe a German
spy. Maybe anybody. This somebody got
in an argument with him over spoils on some
deal, and shot him dead. That&#8217;s my idea,
Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve missed your profession, Delaney.
You&#8217;ve disgraced the firm! How did the library
door get locked on the inside? How did that
happen? Did Stockbridge, shot through the
brain, rise and do it? It was mighty well
locked&mdash;you remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; admitted the operative.
&#8220;Then it looks, Chief, as if it was a case
of suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fosdick said the same thing without having
many facts. How could a right-handed man
shoot himself behind the left ear? How could
he do a thing like that and then get rid of the
weapon without leaving a trace of it? How&mdash;oh,
well, get facts and you won&#8217;t ask such questions!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was done by an outsider?&#8221; blurted
Delaney, staring through the wind-blown snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>which came off the housetops. &#8220;It was done
by the fellow who &#8217;phoned and wrote that letter,
or had the letter written? I don&#8217;t see how
he could do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew smiled at Delaney&#8217;s candor. &#8220;Neither
do I,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve crossed
Forty-second Street and we&#8217;re on the trail by
everyday, up-to-date methods which never fail
if they are continued long enough and men
work hard enough. We&#8217;ll start with Harry
Nichols&mdash;the man in olive-drab! I&#8217;ve his address!&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Delaney stepped behind his chief and
followed in single file as the detective
swung from the Avenue at Thirty-ninth
Street and turned toward the east on the up-town
side of the thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The snow had ceased falling from out the
leaden sky. A roar came to them of the awakening
city which was stirring in its last sleep. A
tug whistled hoarsely somewhere on the East
River. Its blare and signal echoed down the
towering canyon. An answering rattle sounded
from the Elevated. A milk wagon churned by.
A deep-seagoing hansom-cab, of the vintage
of ten years before, struggled along Madison
Avenue as the two detectives paused on the
corner and sought a pathway through the snow
to the opposite side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some night,&#8221; said the operative, pulling
down his derby hat and facing Drew. &#8220;A hell
of a night to be out. Good thing we walked,
though. My head is clearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It needed clearing,&#8221; said the detective.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>&#8220;Some of your deductions were impossible.
Whom do you suppose we&#8217;re going to meet
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry Nichols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Search me, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that over across the street in the
shelter of the stoop? See! He sees us! You
ought to know who that is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks familiar,&#8221; admitted Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s O&#8217;Toole!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Chief. It is! He tailed the lad
in the fur benny from the drug-store and came
here. The lad in the drug-store was Harry
Nichols. The thing works out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get over to the other side of the street and
tell O&#8217;Toole that he can go home and get some
sleep. Tell him to be at the office not later than
eight o&#8217;clock&mdash;this morning. Get what information
you can from him. This brownstone house
with the sign out is our address. I&#8217;ll wait on
the stoop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney was over in three minutes. &#8220;All
right,&#8221; he said cheerfully. &#8220;O&#8217;Toole says that
Nichols left the drug-store and walked south.
Trail led to Fred&#8217;s Old English Chop House
where Nichols drank a split of mineral water
and had a chop with a potato. He &#8217;phoned twice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>before leaving. O&#8217;Toole don&#8217;t know where to.
The booth was soundproof and all the lad did
was to drop coins. He left a piece of paper in
the booth. O&#8217;Toole got it. Here it is, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew slanted a torn portion of envelope and
studied its surface. He deciphered a scrawling
handwriting into the words, &#8220;Loris, Loris,
Gramercy Hill, Attorney Denman of Cedar
Street, will consult with him in morning.... Drew&#8217;s Detective Agency ... look out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; said Drew, pocketing the scrap of
paper with a thoughtful frown. &#8220;That last may
be a warning. Again it could be a mere notation.
What else did O&#8217;Toole find, Delaney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, except that he put the boy to bed
here at about one o&#8217;clock. There&#8217;s a &#8217;phone in
Nichols&#8217; apartment. O&#8217;Toole sneaked up the
stairs and heard it ringing. He had to come
down for fear of queering things. He said
that&#8217;s all, chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective turned and entered the storm-door.
He struck a match and, shielding it with
his hands, searched the names over the mailboxes.
A neat card, set in well-polished
bronze, indicated, &#8220;Harry E. Nichols, Apartment
Three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He keeps this place all of the time,&#8221; said
Drew, jabbing at the button. &#8220;He&#8217;s down on
furlough or Government business. Nice place,
this,&#8221; he added as the inner door-lock clicked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>and he thrust his foot forward. &#8220;Looks like
about two hundred a month. This is exclusively
bachelor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Them bachelor apartments,&#8221; said Delaney
with candor as he glided into the hallway.
&#8220;Them places like this ain&#8217;t what they seem.
There&#8217;s some big parties pulled off in them.
I remembers<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sisst!&#8221; warned Drew, clutching the operative&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;Easy,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Come on.
Somebody is waiting upstairs for us. See his
head in the light by the banister. Same chap,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t see, Chief. Might be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice house,&#8221; commented Drew as his feet
sank in a deep-blue hall carpet. &#8220;Good ornaments
and fixtures throughout the place. Nice
house! Just about what I&#8217;d expected. Here we
are. I&#8217;ll do the talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>A blond pompadour, under which was a pair
of wide gray eyes that blinked at them, greeted
the two detectives as they turned the last landing.
A thick-lipped mouth, in which was considerable
strength and determination, opened
and revealed a double row of strong, young
teeth that would have delighted an Army recruiting
sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you gentlemen want at this
hour of the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>Drew squared his shoulders and pressed Delaney
back a foot or more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry Nichols?&#8221; he asked brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m Harry Nichols.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stockbridge&#8217;s friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>The gray eyes widened perceptibly. The lids
dropped in heavy calculation. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
the young man asked point-blankly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe I ever had the pleasure of meeting either
of you gentlemen.&#8221; Nichols glanced into Delaney&#8217;s
leaning face which was just over his
chief&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Drew softening his
tone. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never met, but we may see considerable
of each other. Here&#8217;s my card!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols took the card, tilted it to the light
from the open door, then dropped it into the
right-hand side pocket of his lounging robe beneath
which blue pajamas showed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; he said without committing himself.
&#8220;Come in, and take off your hats. I&#8217;ve
only two rooms and a bath, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew stepped upon heavy rugs and crossed
the chamber to a chair. He turned this, removed
his hat, and sat down with his legs thrust
outward. His eyes roamed the place in slow
calculation. Dark, old masters, which were
probably good in their day, stared down at him.
A little globe, petticoated in soft silk, gave a
yellow light to the walls and floor. It brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>out Nichols&#8217; features in sharp, actinic shadows.
Drew continued his searching glance. A bed,
with tossed coverlet and sheets, loomed from an
inner room. A table, upon which was an officer&#8217;s
cap and gloves, stood between two doors
that were closed. One of these doors, Drew concluded,
was the bathroom entrance, the other
might have been a closet. His eyes fastened
finally upon a telephone upon a dark-wood
stand. He lifted his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Montgomery Stockbridge is dead!&#8221; he
snapped, darting at Harry Nichols the keen
scrutiny of a man salvoing a surprise.</p>

<p>Nichols glanced at the &#8217;phone. &#8220;I know
that!&#8221; he said with rising color. &#8220;I&#8217;m aware
of that fact, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you first learn of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here! I have your card. I know who
you are. I was almost expecting you, or another
detective. But,&#8221;&mdash;Nichols&#8217; voice raised
to a determined key&mdash;&#8220;but, sir, I am not talking
to anybody about what you just told me.
How do I know who you represent&mdash;the police
or the law or the<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have talked with Miss Stockbridge. She
told you in the drug-store that I was in the
house. She has told you that I was called in
by her father. She undoubtedly &#8217;phoned you,
after she recovered from her faint. You have
the details of the dastardly murder&mdash;if ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>there was one! I represent her. I represent
her friends. I have no other interest in this
case!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols drew out the card and studied
it. He glanced at Delaney. &#8220;Who is this
man?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My right bower. He&#8217;s with me&mdash;and you
and Miss Loris. We&#8217;re together in this. The
police now have the case. What I want is to
protect you and her from the police. What will
they do when they learn from the servants&mdash;which
they will&mdash;that Miss Stockbridge had <i>this</i>
gun in her hand when she entered the library?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew extended his palm. In the hollow of it
lay the little ivory-handled revolver which he
had taken from Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they going to do when they learn
about this?&#8221; he asked with shrewd reasoning.
&#8220;Particularly, Mr. Nichols, when the caliber of
this revolver is probably the same caliber of the
bullet which entered, and is still in, Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s
brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gray eyes narrowed. The lips compressed
until they were white. They seemed
drawn with pain. A faint hiss of surprise
sounded in the room. Harry Nichols turned and
strode to an ornate mantel-piece upon which
was a single cabinet photo. He lifted it impulsively.
He stared at the picture of Loris
Stockbridge as if in it lay inspiration, and resolve.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>He set the photo down and wheeled upon
Drew. His eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have no connection in this case, save
as an adviser,&#8221; he said clearly and from his
heart, &#8220;why are you trying to trap me or her?
Are all detectives alike? Would they rather
see a man in jail than free?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew closed his fingers over the little revolver.
He glanced upward at Delaney&#8217;s towering
bulk which was near the doorway leading to the
outer hall. This door was the only way out of
the apartment. The detective gave no signal to
the operative. His fingers uncoiled and revealed
a thumb pressing upon the silver-plated barrel
from which the leaden noses of six bullets
showed as he turned it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong,&#8221; he said with simple
naïveté. &#8220;You wrong me in this matter. The
affair at Stockbridge&#8217;s will sooner or later
bring you in contact with the Police Department&#8217;s
Detective Bureau. Fosdick, the district
attorney, the coroner, may want to interview
you. The servants, the newspapers, idle tongues
will connect your name with that of Loris Stockbridge.
This connection, taking in the fact that
she had a revolver of the same caliber as was
used to slay her father, may cause trouble. I
want<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s the same revolver&mdash;the
same caliber?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>There was a stubborn defense in the young
man&#8217;s tones which somewhat pleased the detective.
It promised loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not be the same revolver,&#8221; Drew
said softly. &#8220;It may be that the murder was
not committed with a revolver. A rifle, held
close to a man&#8217;s brain, would make the same
kind of mark and burns. I do know this, however,
that the opening in Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s head
is the same size as my lead pencil&mdash;which I have
measured and found to be under a quarter-inch.
It would seem then that twenty-two caliber
might fit the wound. I know of no other
caliber very close to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An army rifle,&#8221; suggested Delaney from
the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is larger,&#8221; said Nichols with a quick
frown. &#8220;The modified Lee-Enfields, which we
are now using, have a greater bore than the
British or German rifles. They are about .30
caliber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever the case,&#8221; Drew said, &#8220;we must
get to our first question. I&#8217;m trying to find
the truth and protect Miss Stockbridge from
the police in case she is suspected. Whose revolver
is this? Who does it belong to? How
came she to have it so soon after meeting you
in the corner drug-store? Did she request it?
Perhaps you will clear these points and allow
me to go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;Before I answer your questions, Mr. Drew,
before I say anything at all, I would rather
have a talk with Miss Loris. You see, we are
too good friends to act apart. I&#8217;ll answer for
her. She is innocent! She is too good, too
pure to have anything to do with it. She never
shot the old&mdash;Mr. Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He threw you out of the house on one occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols clenched his fists. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the
same to you!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;This is my
apartment. What right have you got coming
here and accusing Loris? I don&#8217;t care who you
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the detective, rising and stepping
forward. &#8220;You said just what I wanted
you to say. And you said it like a man who
can wear an American uniform. Shake hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols did not exactly brighten under
the professional flattery. He held out his fingers,
however. Drew clasped his hand after
transferring the revolver to his left palm. He
twirled it as he stepped backward. &#8220;Clean,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It don&#8217;t seem to have been used for
some time. But then, who knows? A gun can
be wiped and polished,&mdash;even in the barrel,&mdash;in
a very few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at Nichols with a silent question
in his eyes. Delaney had already sized
Nichols up as a very clever young man. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>was not far wrong, as he learned when the detective&#8217;s
spoken question was shot through determined
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nichols,&#8221; said Drew, &#8220;did you lend Miss
Stockbridge this revolver? Is it yours? I shall
have to turn it over to the police sooner or
later. They will trace it by the number.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it fully loaded?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned the barrel with his broad thumb.
He clicked the mechanism. He broke it and
held it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s fully loaded.
This is still a merry whirl for six!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Positive, Nichols!&#8221;</p>

<p>The soldier&#8217;s face cleared like a lake from a
storm. He beamed upon Drew. He smiled for
a second time. He pointed toward the chair
which the detective had quitted. &#8220;Sit down,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and make yourself at home. This is
a temperance dugout, but I&#8217;ve got some real
good soft stuff&mdash;grape juice or club soda.
Which will you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a cigar,&#8221; said Delaney.</p>

<p>Drew allowed a smile to creep over his lips.
He waited as Harry Nichols dipped into a kitchenette,
then came back with three glasses of
soda and a huge black Havana.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke up,&#8221; he said good-naturedly to Delaney.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;Light up and take a chair. It&#8217;s daybreak,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, time we&#8217;re going,&#8221; said Drew, setting
his empty glass upon the offered tray. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
go in a minute. Now, as I told you and as you
can see, this revolver is fully loaded. It looks
clean. I suppose you lent it to Miss Stockbridge
without any empty cartridges. These
are the ordinary lead kind which can be secured
at any hardware store. You&#8217;ve got some here,
perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None here. They&#8217;re all up at Plattsburg.
We do some target shooting at times. These little
revolvers don&#8217;t make much noise. You can
use them most anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s satisfactory,&#8221; said Drew, watching
the glow of Delaney&#8217;s cigar. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right.
Now, when she &#8217;phoned for the gun or you suggested
that she better have one with her, what
did she say about the cemetery letter or the
threat over the wire? Did she fear anything
else? Was that her sole reason for having a revolver
with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot expect me to answer for Miss
Stockbridge, Mr. Drew. She is available. You
can talk to her. You represent her. I shall not
say anything concerning her. She is sacred.
The revolver was not discharged. It is the same
as when I gave it to her in the drug-store.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>Therefore, I&#8217;ll trouble you for it. It&#8217;s mine. I
admit that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rose from the chair. His left hand went
out. His fingers clasped Harry Nichols&#8217; shoulder
with a fatherly pressure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the
gun with you. If the police want it, give it to
them. Perhaps they will never hear of it. I
doubt if more than one or two servants saw it
in Miss Loris&#8217; hand when she came into the
library. They may not tell Fosdick. He&#8217;ll try
to rough-shod over them. He may arrest the
entire household&mdash;including Loris. That&#8217;s his
way. It&#8217;s effective, but it&#8217;s not my way. Now
is there anything that you want to say to me
which will clear your mind of this affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols glanced from Drew&#8217;s clean-cut face.
His eyes rested upon the telephone. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to call her up presently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk
with her. I&#8217;ll tell her that you were here&mdash;that
you left the little revolver&mdash;that you
stand ready to swear it was clean and fully
loaded. Then, when I hear what she has to
say about everything, I shall call you up. Is
that satisfactory, Mr. Drew?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective turned the revolver in his palm
and pressed it forward. &#8220;Take it,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and keep it under cover. I&#8217;m off with Mr. Delaney.
Thanks for the club soda.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>&#8220;And the cigar,&#8221; added the big operative as
he opened the door.</p>

<p>Drew hesitated on the landing. He turned
and went back. Nichols stood by the banisters.
The soft light from inside clear-cut the officer&#8217;s
figure like a statue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do me a favor,&#8221; said the detective
in a whisper. &#8220;A damn nice little favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you an extra photo of the girl-in-the-case.
One that&#8217;s laying around somewhere. I
don&#8217;t mean the one on the mantel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For myself. I admire that young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols disappeared through the doorway.
He returned within a minute with a cabinet-size
photo upon the front of which was
written, &#8220;From Loris, January &#8217;18,&#8221; in the vertical
chirography much practiced by social buds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Drew unbuttoning his overcoat
and thrusting the photo within his breast.
&#8220;I shall keep and cherish this, as one of my
most sacred possessions. Congratulations,
young man!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective&#8217;s words rang sincere. Nichols
flushed. He stammered an answer as Drew
hurried down the carpeted steps and joined Delaney
at the storm-door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief,&#8221; said the operative as they reached
the sidewalk and turned toward Madison Avenue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;Chief, why didn&#8217;t you pump that lad
about Stockbridge. You didn&#8217;t ask him a thing
about the old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unethical to a client,&#8221; reproved Drew linking
arm with the operative. &#8220;Come on! We
must hurry! I&#8217;ve an idea&mdash;which is a very
strange thing for a New York detective to have&mdash;that Harry Nichols,
if he stays in town on
furlough, will represent Loris in all matters. I
don&#8217;t know where she could find a better counselor.
He&#8217;s a clam! He told us nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wise boy, Chief! Only fools and women
talk to detectives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; said Drew at this sally. &#8220;Umph!
Well, come on. It&#8217;s quit snowing. It&#8217;s daybreak
over there in the east and I think the
clouds will clear before it gets much later.
You<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Chief!&#8221; exclaimed Delaney clutching
the detective&#8217;s shoulder and wheeling him
around. &#8220;Say, stand right there a minute.
Right in that light. What&#8217;s that on your chin?
Right under the tip of your left ear. Turn
around a little more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew raised his left hand and rubbed it
across his face. He pinched the lobe of his ear
between his thumb and index finger. He whistled
with frosty amazement as he eyed his nail
and thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;What to blazes!&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>&#8220;Turn around! Right under this arc light.
Say, Chief, how did you get that spot of black
on your neck? You&#8217;ve smeared it all over your
collar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. What&#8217;s it look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. Lampblack or soot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew arched his dark brows as he rubbed his
finger-tips together. He held them up to the
stronger light. He turned and glanced back
through the silent walls of the street down
which they had walked. He took one step toward
the east.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; said Delaney. &#8220;Where are you
going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smell that stuff! Smell it!&#8221; Drew thrust
his fingers under Delaney&#8217;s wrinkled nose.
&#8220;Smell it, good and strong!&#8221; he snapped bitterly.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, Chief, it&#8217;s powder, I smell! Gunpowder,
it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph! I must have gotten it from that
gat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t, Chief. That gun was polished
up like a whistle. Besides, how would the spot
come to be under your left ear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew furrowed his brow. He swung in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>snow with new decision. &#8220;Come on!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll think this over! I didn&#8217;t see any soot
on that gat. I don&#8217;t know where I got it either.
Could it have been there for some time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. I just happened to notice it.
Light&#8217;s bright.&#8221; Delaney nodded toward the
arc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get a good look at my face in Stockbridge&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say that I did, Chief. I was too busy
with that howler thing and that magpie and that
murder, to see anything. You might of got it
there without me noticing it. It wasn&#8217;t there
in the taxicab. I&#8217;ll swear to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew passed his fingers across his nostrils
like a man sampling perfume. He repeated the
motion. He scraped some of the powder from
his nails with a pocket knife and dropped the
sample into the crease of an envelope which he
carefully folded and crammed into his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have that analyzed,&#8221; he said, as they
turned toward Fifth Avenue. &#8220;Another trifle
in a chain of circumstance. Think it over, Delaney.
It resembles and smells like powder
which has been burnt. You hurry along home.
Be at the office no later than nine. I&#8217;ll keep on
down Fifth Avenue to the Flatiron Building. I
want to walk and clear my head. I&#8217;ll get some
coffee, pie and rolls, at an all-night restaurant.
I&#8217;ll take time for a shave, shine and shampoo.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>Perhaps I&#8217;ll jump into a Turkish bath to finish
up and get ready for work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to bed at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until I find out who murdered Stockbridge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or how he was murdered?&#8221; said Delaney,
with a puzzled frown as he turned to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I get the murderer, I&#8217;ll find out how he
did it!&#8221; snapped Drew, with a parting glance.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch08'></a>
<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>CHAPTER EIGHT</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;TANGLED WIRES&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>It was five minutes before nine when Delaney
reached the ornate entrance to the
skyscraper wherein were the offices of
Drew&#8217;s Agency.</p>

<p>He wandered into the express elevator,
yawned a &#8220;eighteen, out&#8221; signal to the elevator
pilot and stepped from the cage with the general
air of a man who had spent a hard night
without getting anywhere in particular.</p>

<p>Stopping in the operatives&#8217; room for a few
minutes, he picked up scraps of news concerning
the case at Stockbridge&#8217;s. There was a report,
moreover, that an extra was expected by
ten o&#8217;clock. The air of desertion about the
suite told Delaney plainer than words that
most of the operatives were upon the case. The
entire corps, with few exceptions, had been
working hard while he slept. The telephone-girl
and the assistant-manager, Harrigan,
wound up each of his questions by a nod or a
jerk of the thumb toward the inner office where
Drew was sitting like a spider in a web which
was being spun about the case at hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>Delaney yawned, braced himself with a drink
of ice water drawn from an inverted-bottle, and
stepped toward Drew&#8217;s door. He knocked with
tired knuckles. He pressed forward as he heard
a hearty: &#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative eyed his Chief with sovereign
amazement. Drew looked as fresh as a daisy.
There was a pink tinge upon his olive cheeks.
These cheeks had been close shaven. Oil glistened
from the detective&#8217;s black hair. His mustache
was trimmed and level with his upper lip.
His eyes, as he swung and fastened a clear
glance upon Delaney, were almost too bright.
They were like the hectic fires of an inner furnace.</p>

<p>Delaney searched about the room. He lifted
one foot and then the other with a tired motion.
He leaned against a filing-case like a heavy dray
horse which had come to a final stop. He
yawned behind his big, red hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do it, Chief?&#8221; he asked with a second
yawn. &#8220;I&#8217;m dead on my feet. All the sleep
I got was about thirty minutes. I haven&#8217;t woke
up yet. I met myself going to work this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew laughed quickly and motioned toward a
leather chair. &#8220;Sit down!&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Sit
right down, Delaney. Take it easy for a few
minutes. You seem tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It beats me how you can do it!&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>the operative, sprawling across the chair and
crossing his weary legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;One or two hours&#8217; sleep is never any good.
Better keep awake. You remind me of the last
rose of Sharon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel like a house-man in an all-night poker
game. What&#8217;s the use! I&#8217;m going over to some
bank and get a job as a night watchman, if this
keeps up. I can sleep my head off, there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew swung in his chair and eyed the papers
on his desk. He swiveled as Delaney inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the news in the Stockbridge case?
I&#8217;ve been asking Marie and Harrigan. They
don&#8217;t seem to know anything except that everybody
is out&mdash;already.&#8221; Delaney extended his
huge mouth to a cavernous yawn. He fished up
his great, silver watch. &#8220;What&#8217;s the news,
Chief? Any assignments for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;News? There&#8217;s very little news, Delaney.
No good news, yet! I&#8217;ve been busy as a Chinaman
on a contract, though. I can&#8217;t let that matter
get cold. It&#8217;s now or never in this case!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does our friend Fosdick say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all at sea! I&#8217;ve talked with him twice.&#8221;
Drew glanced at the &#8217;phone. &#8220;He says the murder
was a second Rue Morgue. He can&#8217;t see
any light at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s come around to our deduction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no deduction in it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>&#8220;He says it&#8217;s murder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold, curdling, cunning, crafty murder, Delaney.
The coroner said it would have been impossible
for a man to shoot himself in the manner
Stockbridge was shot. They&#8217;re right&mdash;both
of them&mdash;and we&#8217;re right. I&#8217;ll stake my badge
on it! Particularly in view of the two threats.
Why, I was there when he was called up and
given twelve hours on this earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney glanced out the window. &#8220;Snowing
again,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wonder if there are any
footprints in that back yard or alley. Wouldn&#8217;t
that be a clue, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you told me that the trouble-man said
a tall lad climbed the fence near the junction-box
and beat it for Fifth Avenue. Maybe that
lad left footprints behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re snowed over now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he made them, couldn&#8217;t we find them
underneath?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew&#8217;s eyes narrowed. He leaned in his
chair with a searching glance at Delaney. &#8220;How
long did you sleep?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;About thirty minutes, Chief. Mary and the
kids woke me up and I couldn&#8217;t get settled
again. I did some thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must &#8217;ave! That idea about the footprints
is a mighty good one. There was first
a thaw, then a freeze, then a snow fall which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>preserved everything. If we wait till spring
there might be a set of prints underneath the
other sets. Two of our operatives were there.
The trouble-man was there. He scraped the
connections. If we find a fourth set of prints,
that&#8217;s our man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tall lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Delaney. We can build a box about the
fence and start a thaw of our own. I&#8217;ll think
it over!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go up and do it, Chief. I can make
plaster-casts of all the prints. There&#8217;s a French
system I heard of once. I can find out from
Farot over at Headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep it under cover for a while,&#8221; decided
Drew, sitting down and drawing a sheath of
papers to the edge of the desk. &#8220;Keep it quiet,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney rubbed his chin. He watched Drew
rapidly thumb over the data. &#8220;Say, Chief,&#8221; he
yawned. &#8220;I see another light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; shot Drew over his shoulder.
&#8220;S&mdash;o? Wait a moment before you give it to
me&mdash;you reminded me of something. Where
was the spot of powder on my face? The rubber
in the Turkish bath said it was right here.&#8221;
The detective turned and touched his forefinger
below the lobe of his left ear. &#8220;Right there,&#8221;
he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where it was, Chief. Just where you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>got your finger. It was on the cord. Seems to
me that it was circular in shape. Like a half-moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew raised his black brows in reflective
thought. He opened a small drawer with a sudden
dart of his arm. He poised a mirror so
that the light from the window brought out his
left ear and neck. He dropped the mirror to
the desk. &#8220;Delaney,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s exactly
the spot where Stockbridge was shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative felt a cold chill dart up and
down his tired spine. He came to life with an
oath, and a slap of his huge palm upon his
knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chief, you&#8217;re right!&#8221; he exclaimed, leaning
forward. &#8220;You&#8217;re right! That spot of black
was just where the old man was hit. Now, what
d&#8217;ye make of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew drummed his fingers on the edge of the
polished desk. He tapped his toes on the floor.
He coughed and picked up the mirror for a second
and longer glance at his face and neck. He
tossed the mirror to the desk and swiveled
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I think of it?&#8221; he repeated, with
flashing eyes. &#8220;I think there are features to
this case I don&#8217;t like!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could it have been an accident, Chief? You
might of got a bit of soot from the gun and
then scratched your neck. Maybe that Harry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>Nichols put one over on us. The gun might
have been fired, reloaded, and we never noticed
it. Looks bad for Nichols and the girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew closed his eyelids tightly. His brow
furrowed in deep thought. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the soot or powder came
from the pearl-handled revolver. I don&#8217;t think
so! It would seem to me, Delaney, that intuition
is stronger than evidence. That girl and
that boy rang true. That valet is above suspicion.
The servants are to be trusted. Stockbridge
trusted them and he was noted for his
shrewdness in picking men. The only mistake
he ever made was Morphy. That individual was
out to do the old man. He was a biter, bitten!
I think we&#8217;ll eliminate, for the time, Loris,
Harry, the servants and German influences in
the matter at hand. What was your idea?&#8221;
Drew rubbed his neck beneath his ear, as he
turned to his papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten it, Chief. That spot drove it
all out. No, wait&mdash;say! I&#8217;ve been thinking&mdash;this
morning laying there and listening to the
kids getting ready for school&mdash;that the powder
we smelled in the library wasn&#8217;t ordinary powder.
I know a firecracker, or a regular Chinese
smell when I get near one. That wasn&#8217;t the
kind I got. It was like something else. It was
powder&mdash;all right&mdash;but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew lifted a sheet of paper. &#8220;I covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Analysis made by Higgens,
this morning, shows traces of smokeless-powder
in Stockbridge&#8217;s hair and about the bullet hole.
There&#8217;s a difference. Now, I&#8217;m going further
than that. I&#8217;m going to have those scrapings I
got from my neck looked at. If they are the
same as the powder that was used to slay Stockbridge,
we are getting on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots of smokeless, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble&mdash;that&#8217;s what we are right
up against. Let&#8217;s leave the footprints and the
powder for a few minutes. Both are important.
They&#8217;ll wait. See here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew raised a sheath of papers from his desk,
turned with the chair, and started thumbing
over the data he had accumulated.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he repeated absently. &#8220;First
branch of the tree of Truth in this case is a
stubborn one. It requires considerable work on
our part to get to the end of it. I&#8217;ve sent out
six operatives to scout the telephone calls and
get me some light on them. I&#8217;ve kept some
notes on what they have &#8217;phoned in to me. The
telephone company, the wire-chief at Gramercy
Hill, and an official I know, have been enlisted
in getting to the bottom of these calls. They
have made progress. But, Delaney, of all the
devilish inventions of man, a telephone is the
most subtle. It&#8217;s a wonder to me we have
found anything. It&#8217;s the crook&#8217;s one best tool.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>With it he can play safe, and we can&#8217;t catch
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you found, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew held up a paper. &#8220;The first call, Delaney,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;was the one to the cemetery
company&#8217;s superintendent, notifying him to excavate
a grave in the Stockbridges&#8217; family plot.
Subtle suggestion, that, in the light of what
followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; said Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;This call has received all of the attention it
deserved. It&#8217;s the first of the series, and was
perhaps made before the crook had time to cover
himself completely. It has been traced to a slot
booth in the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in
the Woman&#8217;s Waiting Room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Delaney. That is no criterion that a
woman did the calling-up. The girl there in
charge of the pay-booths states that more men
than women use the &#8217;phones in that part of the
station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just our luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The toll collected on this call must have been
thirty-five cents, including the war-tax. The
superintendent says that the voice over the wire
was thin and tired. He says he thought it was
Dr. Conroy. He never gave the matter second
consideration. Conroy, however, has a
voice like a bull. We checked that up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Does the superintendent know Conroy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Except by name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Chief, I don&#8217;t see any use trying that
lead. It begins and ends in air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It most certainly does! We&#8217;ll cross it out.
The next call for our investigation<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which was?&#8221; asked Delaney, waking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which was the one notifying Stockbridge
that he had about reached his span of life on
this earth. I was there in that library when
the call came in. Again, from the millionaire&#8217;s
description, this time, we have the thin, whispering
voice on the wire. The man was probably
the same. He mentioned the cemetery letter
which would establish that fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m following you, Chief. Go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew picked out a second sheet of paper from
his pile. &#8220;We went after this call at the time,
or soon after the time it was sent in,&#8221; he said,
tapping the sheet with his fingers. &#8220;I called
the office here and had Harrigan get in touch
with George Westlake, third vice-president of
the telephone company. Westlake got busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney eyed his unpolished shoes with a
sage wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Westlake turned things over,&#8221; continued
the detective. &#8220;He made a most thorough investigation.
We have his word that there is no
record of this call! The wire-chief at Gramercy
Hill Exchange declares that it never went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>through the switchboard. That the connection
had been made on the outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks that way. They tried everything and
questioned everybody. No one talked with
Stockbridge through the switchboard at Gramercy
Hill, at or near that hour. Therefore, we
must conclude, that, insomuch as I know somebody
<i>did</i> talk with him at that hour, the connection
was made, either in the junction-box in the
alley or behind the switchboard at Gramercy
Hill Exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about underground, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible! That is&mdash;almost impossible.
The cables are in conduit and sheathed with
lead. It would be a poor place to tap in on a
line. I&#8217;m going to presume that the man who
tapped in knew his business. The junction-box
in the alley is under suspicion. I think it was
done there, in this manner.&#8221; Drew paused and
picked up a third sheet of hurriedly-written
notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A junction-box,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is merely a small
switchboard where the conduit ends and the
house connections begin. It would have been
easy for an expert to disconnect the two leads
which led into Stockbridge&#8217;s library, ring up
with a low tension magneto, and then cut in
with a testing set and a battery current and
do the talking. That is what the trouble-man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>told us might have been done. He found no
signs of tampering. He saw a tall man escaping
down the alley. It would seem, Delaney,
that this tall man is the one we&#8217;re after. Perhaps,
as you said, he left footprints. But footprints,
like fingerprints, are not much use until
you get the man who made them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye deduct in this second call&mdash;Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That we&#8217;ve run squarely up against a blind
wall. We&#8217;ll drop it for a time and go to the
third call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stockbridge was murdered at four minutes
and eighteen seconds past twelve, by his own
watch, Delaney. It was a very good watch!
Now allowing for a movement of the hands
on account of the fall, how are we to account
for a telephone call sent into Gramercy Hill
9763&mdash;the library &#8217;phone&mdash;at exactly five minutes
past twelve from a slot-telephone booth at
the east end of the Grand Central Railroad Station
on Forty-second Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get that, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew chuckled and wheeled in his chair. &#8220;I
got it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by simple arithmetic plus the
vice-president&#8217;s pull. Here&#8217;s how it was found,
Delaney. Easy as two and two. You remember
the howler?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget it, Chief! Not as long as
I live!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The howler established considerable in this
case. The chief operator remembers putting it
on. She remembers the time. She looked back,
after being jogged by George Westlake, and
found that some one had called up Stockbridge
a few minutes after twelve. It was probably
this call to the old man that caused him to be
near enough to the telephone to knock it over
when he was shot. The operator did not hear
the shot, but she remembers a thin, piping voice
asking for Gramercy Hill 9763.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same guy, every time!&#8221; declared the
operative, mopping his brow with his sleeve.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have that fellow for five minutes,
Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get him! We&#8217;ve got the time established
twice. Stockbridge&#8217;s watch fixes the murder
at twelve-four-eighteen. The telephone call
at five minutes past twelve, and the howler put
on soon afterward, checks up. The old man
was alive during the telephone call from the
Grand Central, and dead when the howler was
put on for the first time. Do you see that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney frowned. &#8220;I see it and I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m all balled up, Chief. What with
the magpie and the howler and a man shot in
a locked room and the spot of soot on your neck<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>&mdash;I&#8217;m all twisted into a knot. I think I&#8217;ll go
out and get a drink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Delaney, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
need your head in this case. We&#8217;re squarely up
against class of the highest order. Since Sheeney
Mike and the gas-tube over the transom in
Chinatown, I don&#8217;t know of a more baffling set
of clews. All these calls&mdash;which seem so important
in the case&mdash;lead to a whispering voice
of low pitch and timber. Perhaps the police
records will show such a man who is at large&mdash;very
much at large.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney furrowed his brows and screwed his
face into a painful knot. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to go
back, Chief, to the Morphy case and them
crooked witnesses he had. They all had loud
voices&mdash;like wolves!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I remember them. But then, Delaney,
a man can change his voice. That whole pack
will bear watching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve eliminated some things that were
worrying, Chief. But there&#8217;s some I don&#8217;t see
yet. It&#8217;s impossible for a man to get shot like
that old millionaire was. We went over that
room and that house. We frisked good and
plenty. There was nothing suspicious. The
walls were thick. The floor was hardwood.
The ceiling was some kind of patent plaster,
that&#8217;s like stone. I got two looks at the door,
and you tried the windows. Now what&#8217;s the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>answer, chief? I&#8217;ll say you are never going to
clear this case up. I don&#8217;t think you can. It&#8217;s
going to be one of them unsolved mysteries.
If you do figure something out it ain&#8217;t going
to be proved to my satisfaction. The thing
couldn&#8217;t be done the way it was done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s definite,&#8221; smiled Drew, tapping the
desk with the tips of his well-polished finger
nails. &#8220;You&#8217;re talking in a circle. I&#8217;ll solve
the case, or I won&#8217;t sleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew sorted his papers and bent over them.
He turned the swivel chair by a pressure of his
knee. His eyes narrowed as he studied Delaney&#8217;s
lugubrious face which was sadly in need
of a shave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; he repeated softly. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no such word, Delaney. It&#8217;s a fool&#8217;s excuse.
Now I don&#8217;t want you to be a fool. Don&#8217;t make
the mistake of allowing a seeming impossibility
to dull your efforts. There&#8217;s always a
way around everything which looks high and
impassable. They used to go round the Horn.
Now they cut through the Isthmus. They
used to think men were supernatural. Now
they know that nothing works without a law.
I admit that I don&#8217;t know how Stockbridge came
to his end. I don&#8217;t want to dwell upon it,
either. But this we do know, by these papers,
that he was well-hated, threatened and marked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>for death by an individual or clique of individuals.
That is all we know, and all we ever need
to know, in order to proceed on the basis that
a material agency struck out his life with a material
substance&mdash;such as lead propelled by
smokeless powder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Delaney, rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the library wherein he was slain,&#8221;
continued Drew. &#8220;As for it, we must revert to
simple geometry. Matter occupies space. A
material act was committed by a material body
which got past all our precautions and struck
the magnate down. What is there in this world,
which is at one and the same time, material and
yet capable of penetrating through a door or
wall without a trace? Give me that answer,
and we&#8217;ll get results. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damned if I know! I&#8217;m all balled up! You
talk like a college professor. You mean something
that is and something that isn&#8217;t. Good
morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney reached for the door knob with a
gesture of disdain. Drew wheeled and stared
at him. &#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; he said softly.</p>

<p>The operative turned and dropped his hands
to his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the magpie?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>Delaney nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sit down and wait. It&#8217;ll be here within
five minutes. The valet &#8217;phoned he was bringing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>it in a taxi. That was just before you came
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taxi!&#8221; snorted the big operative, stretching
himself on the leather chair. &#8220;Them valets
have got it soft. Last night was the first ride
I&#8217;ve had in one for months, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney&#8217;s voice trailed to an end. He turned
in the chair and saw Harrigan&#8217;s red face and
auburn hair come slowly through the aperture
made by opening the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; snapped Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a funny lookin&#8217; guy out here,
chief,&#8221; said the assistant-manager. &#8220;He wants
to see you in person. He&#8217;s got knee-britches
and a bunch of brass-buttons on his monkey-jacket.
Says he&#8217;s a valet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he got anything with him?&#8221; asked
Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has, Chief! He&#8217;s got a gilded cage with
the damnedest looking bird in it I ever saw. It
ain&#8217;t a parrot and it ain&#8217;t a crow. It&#8217;s a blue-jay
or something like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him in!&#8221; Drew said. &#8220;Show him in.
You can wait, Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;MEN AND MOTIVES&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The two detectives leaned back in their respective
chairs and eyed each other. Both
swung and stared out of the window at
the swirling snow which salted across the window
in an unending curtain of white. Both
returned to the locked stare so common to men
who have worked together in danger and know
each other&#8217;s merits.</p>

<p>Delaney&#8217;s eyes dropped first. He studied the
rug beneath Drew&#8217;s polished shoes. He coughed
behind his hand, and turned with a shrug of
his shoulders. He fastened upon the closed
door a glance of expectancy which brought a
smile to the chief&#8217;s lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are picking up,&#8221; said Drew, with
a short laugh. &#8220;Your friend&mdash;the bird&mdash;has
arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend?&#8221; blurted the big operative.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no friend of mine! I&#8217;d wring its neck,
gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be the key to the whole thing.
Smarter men than the ones we are fighting have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>fallen through less. You remember Eddy, The
Brute, who left his umbrella after him in the
Homesdale Murder Mystery. Funny, wasn&#8217;t
it? Took three months to plan the murder and
left his rain-stick behind. His initials were on
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t get away<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; started Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your bird!&#8221; announced Drew, as a
knock sounded on the door. &#8220;Move over and
let that valet stand there. I want the light in
his eyes when we&#8217;re talking to him. Always get
the light in the other fellow&#8217;s eye. Sisst!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door opened to a crack&mdash;then wide. The
valet came in with an important strut. He
turned and deposited a cage at Delaney&#8217;s big
feet. The operative moved back with a grunt
of disgust. He eyed the cage and contents with
a homicidal expression. His eyes raised and
fastened upon the valet. He hooked his broad
thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest and took a
deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re satisfied,&#8221; he said to Drew,
who was smiling. &#8220;I hope this black sparrow
don&#8217;t start anything. I&#8217;ll finish it, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; asked the chief, turning
and consulting a paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otto Braun,&#8221; said the valet. &#8220;Otto Braun,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Born in Cologne ... year, sixty-three ... worked as valet and major domo for British
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>families ... came to America with Mr. Stockbridge,
and have been with him since?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct, sir,&#8221; the valet said, with a
start of amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twice&mdash;sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wife living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both, sir. I&#8217;m paying a small alimony to
both.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney grunted. His foot went out toward
the magpie which had finished hopping about
the perches of the cage, and was listening with
head cocked sideways.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you have charge of this bird?&#8221; asked
Drew, turning fully around and facing the valet
with heavy-lidded intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m its keeper, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney coughed explosively. He leaned
down to cover his confusion. He jabbed a
thumb at the bird.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s savage,&#8221; he rumbled. &#8220;It pecked at
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; warned Drew, with a quick frown.
&#8220;Easy, Delaney. I want to get to the facts of
this case. We&#8217;re wasting time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had you come down here,&#8221; said Drew,
turning to the valet, &#8220;in order to find out about
that magpie. You had charge of it when Mr.
Stockbridge was alive?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>&#8220;Yes, sir. I fed it and kept it clean,
for the&mdash;master.&#8221; The valet sniffled slightly. Drew
watched him with keen eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it repeat much of Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s
conversation?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m trying to get at is, whether or
not the bird was in the habit of repeating words
that seemed to strike its fancy. Did it act like
a parrot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very much like a parrot, sir. Sometimes
it was sulky and wouldn&#8217;t say anything for
days. Other times, sir, we had trouble keeping
it quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned in his chair and fingered a paper.
&#8220;I looked up everything I can find in my
library here, in regard to magpies,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Is there any difference between an ordinary
magpie and a Spanish one?&#8221; he added, turning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, sir. They can all be taught
to talk&mdash;the same as a parrot, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if this bird should repeat a word, or
two words, over and over again it would be
plausible to assume that some one had used the
word or two words. I want to make myself
clear,&#8221; Drew added with engaging candor.
&#8220;What I&#8217;m getting at is important in view of
the fact that this magpie used two words after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>we broke down the door to the library and
found Mr. Stockbridge murdered.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney leaned forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;The words this bird used were &#8216;Ah Sing,&#8217;
as near as we can arrive at them. Did you ever
hear it repeat that couplet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that I have, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective lifted his brows and stared at
the cage. &#8220;Repeat that,&#8221; he said to Delaney.
&#8220;Repeat what we heard in the library.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sing! Ah, Sing! Ah, Sing!&#8221; boomed
the operative.</p>

<p>The magpie ruffled its feathers and darted
about the cage like a sparrow in a barrel.
&#8220;Keep it up,&#8221; said Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sin! Ah, Sing! Ah, Singing!&#8221; roared
Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do! You&#8217;ve frightened it. Let it
alone for a while. We&#8217;ll keep it here, Otto.
I&#8217;ll send it back in a few days. How&#8217;s Miss
Stockbridge bearing the strain, up at the
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t left her room, sir. Mr. Nichols
called. The Red Cross people called. There&#8217;s
been lots of callers, sir, but she hasn&#8217;t appeared,
sir. It&#8217;s early, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at his watch. &#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed softly as the valet bowed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>replaced his hat and passed out without glancing
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good servant,&#8221; said Drew, rising and
kneeling down beside the cage. &#8220;Now, Delaney,&#8221;
he added tersely. &#8220;Now, old sleepy
head, we have the key to the case locked here.
I don&#8217;t doubt but that you unconsciously struck
the right clew when you bawled your little
hymn. You said, &#8216;Ah, Singing.&#8217; Now couldn&#8217;t
that be Ossining?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, Chief, it could!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, more likely, Ah! Sing Sing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The bird!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who taught the bird?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody taught it! It might have been the
last thing said by Stockbridge&mdash;just before he
was shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the bird repeated it&mdash;to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly! A parrot or a magpie is a living
phonograph. They reproduce a sound, at times,
without any idea of knowing what they are saying.
This bird may have been so frightened by
the shot which was fired in the library, that it
recalled the words used by Stockbridge before
the shot was fired. These words, in my opinion,
tell us that the millionaire was &#8217;phoning to some
individual, probably the whispering-voiced
man. This individual and Ah, Sing! or Ah,
Sing Sing! or Ah, Singing! or Ossining! are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>closely allied. Now who of Stockbridge&#8217;s enemies
does that fit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rose to his feet and dusted his knees.
&#8220;Is that clear?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clear as mud, Chief! I don&#8217;t get it yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will,&#8221; said the detective, dropping
down in his chair and reaching for his papers.
&#8220;See these,&#8221; he added, swiveling and darting
a quick glance at the bird-cage. &#8220;These, Delaney,
are a list of the old man&#8217;s known enemies.
I have compiled this list from the secretary&#8217;s
statements, my own newspaper reading,
the facts we gained at Morphy&#8217;s trial, and
from what Stockbridge told me in the library
before he was slain.&#8221; Drew counted the list
with a steady finger. &#8220;There&#8217;s seven,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all! I thought there was more &#8217;an
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Seven is the number! He was well
hated as you will see. First and foremost we
have Mortimer Morphy, who is serving from
ten to twenty years in state prison, with other
indictments hanging over his iron-gray head.
He&#8217;s the captain of them all. He lacks soul,
conscience and heart. &#8216;The Wolf of the Ticker&#8217;
they used to call him. I had the warden on the
wire this morning. He&#8217;s ready to aid justice
to the limit. He says that Morphy, or rather
Convict 87313, I think they call them inmates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>up there, is well and working. He&#8217;s in charge
of the books in the front office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d never keep any books for me!&#8221; declared
Delaney.</p>

<p>Drew nodded. &#8220;Me, either,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
have heard too much about his past to trust
his future. Stockbridge always feared him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he fit what the black crow said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does, most certainly! Sing Sing and
Morphy are linked together in every way. Morphy
must have been mentioned on the wire and
Stockbridge shouted, &#8216;What, in Sing Sing?&#8217; or
words to the same meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Delaney, glancing at the magpie
with round eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then comes Vogel, who was at state&#8217;s
prison, but whom they transferred to the hospital
at Glendale, where he is said to be dying
of tuberculosis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember him. A little runt with a big
nose. That might be the whispering voice,
Chief, if he&#8217;s got T. B.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly! I also had Glendale on the &#8217;phone,
or Harrigan did. They say Vogel is right there
and is going to stay there, if fifty guards will
keep him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Next, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next is Vogel&#8217;s partner, Ross. You
remember him? A good-natured, fat fellow
with a bald head. He was always smiling. He&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>making little rocks out of big ones in a convict
camp near Lake George. He was at Sing Sing,
or Ossining, for a time. Most of the New York
prisoners are taken there first. It&#8217;s a sort of
clearing house for the other prisons of the
state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would he fit in with what this bird said,
Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, I&#8217;m getting interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Drew, &#8220;we have the two brokers
who handled Morphy&#8217;s Blue Sky, preferred;
Flying Boat, and other swindles. They
are at Sing Sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s their names, Chief? I&#8217;ve forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Greene and Goldberg! One confessed and
one turned state&#8217;s evidence. They got off with
from two to four years. A nice bunch of
squealers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be out pretty soon, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but they&#8217;re harmless. I don&#8217;t think
they had anything to do with the murder of
Stockbridge. The other fellow might.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Finklestein&mdash;the banker. The one who
went before the Grand Jury and claimed exemption.
He&#8217;s somewhere on the outside. I
think Flynn is covering him. I sent him over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>to Jersey, where Finklestein has a place near
Morristown. We&#8217;ll hear of him later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney shifted his big feet and started
counting on his fingers. He widened his eyes.
&#8220;There&#8217;s one more,&#8221; he said, as Drew leaned
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s one more. I kept him for the
last. He&#8217;s out of sight, reach and hearing.
You know who I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That guy who invented wireless boat, or flying
boat, or them movie-picture things in seventeen
colors. I know who you mean. He beat
it, slick as any porch-climber. What&#8217;s his
name, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morphy&#8217;s brother, Cuthbert Morphy! He&#8217;s
an electrical-engineer and the inventor of all
their shady promotions. He&#8217;s the real brains
of the mob. You never saw him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say that I have!&#8221; declared Drew with
a snap. &#8220;I call him one of my failures. I&#8217;ve
made enough. Remember how Flood and Cassady
searched for him after the others were
arrested? He&#8217;s cost us thousands of dollars&mdash;without result.
I charged it to Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which way did he go, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He beat it for Argentine. From there he
went across South America to Antofagasta.
From there he disappeared like a rocket in No
Man&#8217;s Land. No trace was found. For all we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>know, he might be right here in little old New
York&mdash;the best hiding place in the known world.
I hate to think of the places a man could plant
in this town!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! But they always come around the
old corner. Remember Dutch Gus, the boxman.
Five years, Chief, in every town on the
map, and then he was picked up at Forty-second
Street and Broadway. Maybe your friend, Cutbert,
will show up some day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cuthbert!&#8221; corrected Drew. &#8220;He&#8217;s no
friend of mine, Delaney. The trouble is, we
haven&#8217;t got a single photograph of him. That
shows he was figuring on crime all his life.
A man who don&#8217;t get his picture taken, is generally
a man to watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s slick, Chief. What does he look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew pressed a buzzer-button. &#8220;Look like?&#8221;
he said, turning toward the door. &#8220;Oh, he is a
little fellow, quick-tempered and probably
handy with a gat. He&#8217;s dangerous. I think
Cuthbert Morphy is a good lead if we can find
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never did like that first name!&#8221; Delaney
blurted as Harrigan opened the door to a crack.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you found out about Harry
Nichols?&#8221; asked Drew, as the assistant-manager
stepped in softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got Plattsburg, Chief,&#8221; said Harrigan
briefly. &#8220;Harry is O. K. up there. Captain&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>commission. Three months intensive training.
Going to France soon. On fourteen-days&#8217; furlough
in New York. Was floor manager for
Harris, Post and Browning. Quit good job to
go in the Army. Harris, of the brokerage firm,
says Harry can come back and hang up his hat
any time. That&#8217;s about all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine, in a way.
He couldn&#8217;t have a better record. Now we&#8217;ll
lay him aside. What did Frick learn at Ossining?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frick &#8217;phoned once. I was going to connect
you with him but that fellow with the bird-cage
came in. Frick says the warden is O. K. and
will lend every aid. He saw Morphy in the Auditor&#8217;s
Department. Looks worried, he says.
Getting old! The visitor&#8217;s list shows that he&#8217;s
had an average of three visits a month. No
sign of his brother. There&#8217;s a fellow calls,
though, who might be Cuthbert Morphy. Answers
general description. They&#8217;ll pinch him
next time he comes. We never thought of looking
for him there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! We were going to <i>send</i> him there!
It&#8217;s like a crook, though, to play with fire. What
else did Frick say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing more, Chief. He&#8217;s looking around.
He says he&#8217;ll report as soon as there is anything.
He says<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buurr! Burrr! Burrrr!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>Drew turned and snatched up the telephone
receiver. He pressed the diaphragm to his ear.
&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said tersely. &#8220;Connect me.
Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney breathed deeply and watched his
chief&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; whispered Drew. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he added guardedly.
&#8220;Yes, Commissioner.... What? You say that ... that the autopsy on
Stockbridge&#8217;s body&mdash;head&mdash;shows what? Repeat
it! I can&#8217;t quite hear what you are saying.
Louder, Commissioner! That&#8217;s better.
Yes&mdash;all right now, Fosdick. It shows.... It
shows that the typo cupronickle bullet found in&mdash;in, ... repeat that.... In Stockbridge&#8217;s brain
was not scored or ... or what? ... Marked? ... Wait! I don&#8217;t get your meaning.... It
was lodged in the soft tissues of the.... Yes! ... I see! Go on.... There were no rifling
marks on it.... What?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned and motioned toward the open
door. Harrigan closed it softly as the detective
resumed his position at the &#8217;phone. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he
said tersely. &#8220;Yes, Fosdick. That&#8217;s important.
I should say it was important! ... New
wrinkle, what? ... Why, I&#8217;d think at a quick
jump that the bullet which killed the old man
wasn&#8217;t fired from a regulation revolver.... Yes, it couldn&#8217;t of! ... It must have been fired
from a smooth-bore rifle or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>pistol!... What? ... Yes.... It seems that way to me.... Are you dead sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited. He tapped the desk with a
pencil. He reached with his right hand and
pulled a sheet of paper to him. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he
said slowly. &#8220;Yes, go on, Commissioner. Oh,
I&#8217;ve been busy! Yes. You have! Well.... I
wouldn&#8217;t of. No, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right
lead at all. They&#8217;re all right. All right.... Go to it! ... Good-by, Fosdick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective flipped the receiver on the hook
and slowly swung the chair. His eyes darted
first at Harrigan and then rested upon Delaney&#8217;s
broad face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That damn fool!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He&#8217;s
pinched the whole bunch of servants. He&#8217;s
looking for the valet. The butler is under lock
and key. All that&#8217;s left up there is the housekeeper
and some housemaids and Miss Loris.
He better not touch her! Brass Band Fosdick!
He&#8217;s a mile off the case!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about that bullet, Chief?&#8221; asked Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! That&#8217;s new! It&#8217;s different and important.
The coroner&#8217;s inquest shows&mdash;the autopsy,
I mean&mdash;that the bullet found in the millionaire&#8217;s
brain was a cupronickle affair of
twenty-two caliber projected by smokeless powder
from a smooth-bore weapon held not more
than three inches from the old man&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whistled Delaney. &#8220;That&#8217;s going
some, Chief,&#8221; he added, rising. &#8220;But what
does it mean? I ain&#8217;t got that at-tall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I!&#8221; snapped Drew. &#8220;We&#8217;re only getting
deeper and deeper into facts. After a while
we&#8217;ll have enough of them to solve the case.
The smooth bullet is important. It suggests
many things&mdash;a home-made gun, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Might have been an old Civil War gun,
Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there was anything like that
in Stockbridge&#8217;s house. You might inquire
when you go up. He was very modern with his
Flying Boat stock and his improved munitions
for the Allies. He has no old collection of
arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney stared at Harrigan. Drew swung to
his desk and tapped the blotter for a moment.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll get busy,&#8221; he said briskly, as he swung
back again and faced the two operatives. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
almost got my man. That bird there,&#8221; Drew
pointed toward the magpie, &#8220;is our one best bet
and lead. I may be wrong, but I&#8217;ll wager a
good cigar there&#8217;s a convict or ex-convict at
the back of this case. How else can we explain
&#8216;Ossining&#8217; or &#8216;Ah, Sing&#8217; repeated through the
magpie to us. It&#8217;s not an impossible clue. It
might happen. Let&#8217;s move with both feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney rose lankily and stood by the door.
He braced his shoulders, then shelved them forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>as he reached a finger toward the bird-cage.
&#8220;Pretty Poll!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The magpie darted about the cage like a shaft
of blue light. It came to rest with its tail
feathers thrust through the bars. It peered
with beaded eyes at Drew who had snatched up
a bundle of papers and was sorting them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get busy, Delaney, on this assignment!&#8221; he
said sharply. &#8220;Waste no time. Run up to
Stockbridge&#8217;s and get me plaster-paris casts
of all the footprints you can find around that
junction box. It&#8217;s stopped snowing,&#8221; he added,
glancing out the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Stop somewhere on your
way up-town and find out the exact temperature
changes last night. What I want you to get is
a record of every quarter-hour, so as to show
when the early, packed snow in Stockbridge&#8217;s
yard froze solid. The under crust!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got that in my head, Chief! That&#8217;s my
idea, exactly. If a tall lad tapped in on the
junction box early in the night his footprints
will be frozen close to the ground. The whole
surface is level now, but there ought to be ice-posts
sticking up when I get done thawing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! You&#8217;ll probably find the trouble-hunter&#8217;s
and one other set of prints. The
other set is our man&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>&#8220;What size feet did the trouble-hunter
have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Small&mdash;about six!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Chief, I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Walt a minute.&#8221; Drew studied a sheet of
paper. &#8220;After you get the temperature data,
Delaney,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After you get that and
the plaster casts of the footprints, go into the
house and stay there. Watch Miss Loris. Don&#8217;t
talk to Fosdick&#8217;s men. Tell her to be careful.
Tell her that she is in grave danger. Remember
that the same man who threatened Stockbridge
over the wire, also said he was going to
get her. Remember that, Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a shave!&#8221; shot Drew out through the
closing doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that little thing,&#8221; came echoing back
with a hearty chuckle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Harrigan,&#8221; Drew said, shuffling the
slips of paper like a deck of cards. &#8220;Now, we&#8217;re
closing in on our man or men. See if you can
find Frick at the prison. &#8217;Phone from the
booth!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan was back within three minutes. He
leaned over Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frick was with the warden,&#8221; he whispered
tersely. &#8220;He was easy to get. He says that
Morphy has been trying to telephone<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8220;Tryin&#8217; to telephone, Chief<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he got to do with the telephone?
What right has an inmate of a prison got to
phone? Unless&mdash;unless the warden thought
the case was justified&mdash;like in sickness or important
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe the warden allowed him, Chief. I
didn&#8217;t ask Frick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out there and ask him! Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited with every muscle taut. He
drummed the table with impatient fingers. He
thumbed the sheath of papers he had collected
on the Stockbridge case. He wheeled in his
chair and stared out through the frosted window
with unseeing eyes. The vision came to
him of a pompous old man in prison gray, strutting
about the front office with silk socks and a
Havana cigar. Drew had no sympathy with a
certain kind of convict. The misguided safeblower
or house prowler might be excused for
a great many things. The pickpocket was a professional,
who took his chances as they ran.
The gentleman bank-wrecker, with his overextended
tale of woe and his bid for the world&#8217;s
sympathies, was the one the detective detested
with all his soul. Such men, he believed, were
beyond the pale. They knew better. Morphy,
for instance, had not only gotten away with
much of widow&#8217;s and orphan&#8217;s money, but he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>had wrecked a score of homes and dragged
down many with him at the final assizes.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he uses the phone!&#8221; Drew repeated like
an indictment. &#8220;Well! Well! Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan stepped in through the door. Drew
turned away from the window and stared at
the assistant-manager. &#8220;What did you find?&#8221;
he snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found enough, Chief! Frick says that Morphy
is the whole thing up there. They call him
the &#8216;Assistant-Warden,&#8217; in jest. The Welfare
League won&#8217;t have anything to do with him.
They got him down for a squealing &#8216;rat.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fool the Gray Brotherhood,&#8221; said
Drew. &#8220;Their rooms are too close together.
What about this telephoning? Who was it to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A telephone booth in the Subway Station at
Times Square!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Frick says it was! He tried to listen but
Morphy came out and looked around twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective rose from his chair and grasped
Harrigan&#8217;s narrow shoulders with fingers of
steel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out there!&#8221; he ordered through line-drawn
lips. &#8220;Get out there and phone from
the soundproof booth. Ask my friend&mdash;the vice-president
of the telephone company&mdash;to find
out for us whether Morphy or anybody else in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>the prison telephoned at four minutes past
twelve this morning. Get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was when Stockbridge was shot,
wasn&#8217;t it, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was!&#8221; exclaimed Triggy Drew.</p>

<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>CHAPTER TEN</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;A WOMAN CALLS&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The business of a modern detective agency
is managed in much the same manner as
a corporation or a large firm of corporation
lawyers. Its tentacles, or operatives, are
spread over the globe. Its news and assignments
come in via wire. Its telephone and telegraph
bills amount to thousands of dollars
every year. In no other way can satisfactory
results be secured.</p>

<p>Drew had started his agency on a shoestring
and ran it into a &#8220;tannery,&#8221; in the parlance
of the street. He had made many mistakes. He
had once, to his knowledge, sent the wrong man
to prison. This mistake had been so costly, he
never spoke of it. It was soon after the conviction
of the innocent man, that Drew gave up
circumstantial evidence and got down to hard
work, wherein the evidence accumulated was
tempered with some degree of fact and common
sense.</p>

<p>The first Stockbridge case had been in connection
with an absconder. This man, Drew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>brought back in person from Adelaide. The
work so pleased the millionaire that when Morphy
broke under the financial strain and robbed
everybody, right and left, Drew was called in to
bring the promoter to the bar of justice. It
was a long fight, fraught with danger and disappointment.
The courts dragged. War broke
over the civilized world. Morphy fought fiercely&mdash;like a cornered
hyena. He was sent away,
after dragging down his confederates. He had
sworn at the time of conviction that he would
get Stockbridge if it took to the longest day of
his life. Drew remembered this oath and promise
as he waited for Harrigan to appear from
the booth.</p>

<p>He turned to the magpie and the cage. He
studied both with keen eyes which had been
trained in the school of hard facts piled upon
each other until they pointed a way. Stockbridge
had owned the pet for many years. It
was the one domestic trait in his make-up, save
Loris. It would be a strange thing, Drew concluded,
swinging toward the window, if Morphy
and Morphy&#8217;s confederates were to fall
through a remembered couplet dropped by the
magpie. It was in the order of events, however.
It was the bright, particular finger which
pointed toward the prisoner at Sing Sing. Nothing
would be more logical than for the bird to
remember the millionaire&#8217;s last words&mdash;or dying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>words. They would be shrieked aloud and
unforgetable.</p>

<p>&#8220;More snow,&#8221; said Drew to himself. &#8220;This
is a white day if ever there was one. I wonder
if Delaney got to the house in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned as a &#8220;Buurrrr! Burrrr!&#8221; sounded
at the ringing-box below the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said sharply into the transmitter.
&#8220;Hello! Who&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited as some out-of-town connection
was made. A thin voice broke in from the silence.
The voice rose in timber. &#8220;Oh, Hello!&#8221;
exclaimed the detective, recognizing Flynn, one
of his operatives. &#8220;Hello, Flynn,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the weather like out at Morristown?
Yes! ... Yes! ... Oh, is that so.... What? ... Too bad! ... Well, you better come
in.... Take the first train and jump on the job.... He&#8217;s in Florida, eh? ... Well, that lets
him out.... Good-by, Flynn!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew reached for a pencil and scratched a
name off his list before he hung up the receiver.
&#8220;That leaves six,&#8221; he said, running his eyes
down the names of the suspects. &#8220;Six to go.
We&#8217;ll round them up&mdash;or out. It looks bad for
one or two of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped the pencil to the desk with a flip
of his fingers. He replaced the telephone receiver
on the hook. He twirled the chair and
leaned forward with his hands on his knees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>&#8220;Nice bird, you,&#8221; he said, addressing the
magpie. &#8220;We&#8217;re alone, you and I. Why don&#8217;t
you tell me what you know&mdash;what you heard in
that library, when the millionaire talked over
the phone and then received the cupronickle
bullet in the base of his brain? He said, &#8216;Ah,
Sing!&#8217; eh? He said it, or we are jumping at
conclusions. Have Delaney and I erred&mdash;as
once or twice before?&#8221;</p>

<p>The bird strutted about the cage. It pecked
at a hard, white fish-bone, thrust between two
bars. It dipped its bill into the water-holder,
then held high its head as it gulped. It switched
its tail and hopped onto the first perch. There
it sat, with coiled claws, as Drew leaned closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sing!&#8221; he repeated confidentially. &#8220;Ah,
Singing! Ossining! Sing Sing! Let me hear
you do your prettiest, birdie. Don!&#8221;</p>

<p>The magpie lowered its head and peered outwardly.
It lifted a wing with ruffled dignity.
Drew narrowed his eyes. &#8220;You were there,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;You were in that sealed room&mdash;that double-locked
and triple-watched library.
How did the murderer shoot down the old man?
How could he do it, Don? I think I know <i>why</i>
it was done. I&#8217;m fairly sure who is directing
matters. What I want to know is, what devilish
ingenuity of the criminal tribe projected that
bullet into the old man&#8217;s brain? Answer that,
Don!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>The bird was as stately as a raven. It seemed
to Drew that he heard an echoed &#8220;Nevermore.&#8221;
He sat upright and took his hands from his
knees. &#8220;Answer that, Don?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone batty, Chief?&#8221; asked Harrigan,
thrusting his shoulders through the open door.</p>

<p>Drew glanced up. He passed his hand over
his forehead in a sweeping motion as if brushing
cobwebs from his brain. &#8220;Guess I am,&#8221;
he admitted, with a sparkling glance at the paper
held in the assistant&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Well!&#8221; he
snapped, recovering himself. &#8220;Well, what luck?
I see that you got something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep! I got him, all right. He&#8217;s hanging
around the front office of the prison seeing what
he can find out. He says,&#8221; Harrigan consulted
the paper. &#8220;He says, Morphy has been worried
all morning. That he acts like a man in a
daze. Always<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want that, now! Didn&#8217;t I send you
out to call up the vice-president of the telephone
company? The same man who helped us early
this morning. Westlake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was getting to him, Chief! He was busy
when I called, so I thought I&#8217;d get Frick again.
That&#8217;s all Frick had to say, except a<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except he&#8217;ll stay there until he receives instructions
from you to the contrary. Says he&#8217;ll
report if anything turns up.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;Go on with Westlake!&#8221; The detective&#8217;s
voice hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I got him, finally. Had to wait till
he cleaned out the callers in his office. He&#8217;s
in charge of maintenance and equipment. He
says that their records show<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show what?&#8221; Harrigan had scowled at his
own writing. &#8220;It took some time to get this,
Chief. Oh, I see. Well, the records of the
Westchester Company shows three long-distance
calls from the prison between six o&#8217;clock
last night and this morning. The first one was
at seven-ten P. M. to a slot booth at the east
end of the New York Central Railroad Station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; snapped Drew. &#8220;Good! Go on!
We&#8217;re getting there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This call was for seventeen minutes. It was
charged to the prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the booth number?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan consulted his sheet. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t get
that,&#8221; he said, scratching his head. &#8220;Westlake
didn&#8217;t give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on&mdash;we&#8217;ll get it! Go on! What was the
next call?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The second call, Chief, was to the State Capitol
Building at Albany. It was for three minutes.
No more! I guess that was the warden
talking to the Pardon Clerk, or something like
that. We&#8217;ll forget it, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;Chop it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The third and last call, Chief,&#8221; said Harrigan
with haste, &#8220;was to the same telephone-booth
at the Grand Central Station. Ah, here&#8217;s
the number! That&#8217;s why Westlake didn&#8217;t give
it to me on the first call to the booth. Number,
Gramercy Hill 9845, Chief. That&#8217;s over near
the east end of the building&mdash;on the lower
level.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A quiet place!&#8221; mused Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Well, Chief, here is the time. The
call was for twenty-two minutes, extending from
a quarter to twelve&mdash;midnight&mdash;to seven minutes
after twelve. It was charged to the Auditing
Department of the prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rose from his chair. &#8220;That covers the
hour in which Stockbridge was murdered!&#8221; he
declared, reaching for the roll-top of his desk
&#8220;That&#8217;s nice work on your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan flushed slightly. He leaned over
and laid the paper upon the desk. Drew took
it, folded it with two fingers forming the
creases, then crammed it into his breast pocket
The roll-top came down with a bang. Harrigan
lifted an overcoat from a tree, helped Drew on
with it, and found the detective&#8217;s hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you be back, Chief?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard to say! Get me some French-gray
powder. A little will do. I&#8217;m going to see if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>I can get any fingerprints in that booth. They
might help!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you be back by night!&#8221; Harrigan
asked, leading the way through the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know! Get that powder! Tell Delaney,
if he calls up, that I&#8217;m hot after my
man. Tell him to stick up where he is, till he
hears from me. Tell Flynn, when he comes in
from Morristown, that he can relieve O&#8217;Toole
who is trailing Harry Nichols. I don&#8217;t think
there is much in that. I&#8217;m covering every one&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harrigan opened the drawer of a cabinet and
fingered about till he found a small, round box
of gray powder used for preserving fingerprints.
He turned with this and saw that Drew
had crammed into his side coat-pocket, a flat
camera which the telephone girl brought to him.
&#8220;Got flash lights?&#8221; asked Harrigan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s some in the back of this camera.&#8221;
Drew slapped his overcoat. &#8220;I got
everything, I guess. Remember about Delaney
and Flynn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective moved toward the door which
led to the hallway where the elevators were.
He turned as Harrigan laid a hand on his shoulder.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that sticking out of your other
pocket, Chief?&#8221; asked the assistant-manager.
&#8220;A paper, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew flushed beneath his olive skin. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>pressed the object down with soft fingers. He
turned and said simply:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a picture of the girl in the case. Forgot
I had it. Good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door slammed as he strode over the white
tiling and jabbed at an elevator button with
his right thumb.</p>

<p>Swirled in wind-blown snow from the office
buildings and wrapped to the chin with the collar
of his overcoat, Drew plunged, with head
downward, for the nearest subway station.</p>

<p>He caught an up-town express, and, after
three grinding station-stops, he reached the
Grand Central Station wherein was the telephone-booth
to which the calls had been sent
from the prison.</p>

<p>He made swift work of the matter at hand.
Time was pressing. The booths, to the number
of three in that portion of the station, were fortunately
empty.</p>

<p>Going over the slot-box and the tiny shelf
in the center booth, which bore the number
&#8220;Gramercy Hill 9845&#8221; on the transmitter, Drew
pulled the door shut and dusted all the nickel
work and the polished surface of the receiver,
with French-gray powder of superior make.</p>

<p>He took three exposures by aid of small
flashes. He opened the door and allowed the
smoke to escape. Pocketing the camera, after
winding on a fresh film, he entered the booth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>for a second time and inspected its lower
paneling for possible clews.</p>

<p>An oath, close-bitten and expressive, escaped
his lips as he discovered a small hole drilled
through the woodwork. He stooped and peered
through this opening. It led to the next booth.
It had been made with a long auger of quarter-inch
diameter. Shavings lay upon the floor of
the booth.</p>

<p>He emerged and investigated the second
booth. The hole came through, underneath the
slot-box. It had been drilled in order to make a
connection between the two telephones. He
found splinters and sawdust at his feet. He
backed out and stood perplexed. There was no
way of finding out just what sort of connection
had been made between the two booths. All evidence
of wires had been taken down. Only an
expert could give an answer to the new riddle.
Drew recalled Westlake as he rushed to the subway-platform.</p>

<p>He found the vice-president busy, with a
score of men waiting in the outer room of the
telephone company&#8217;s office. The secretary-in-charge
hurried in with his card and his urgent
request for three minutes&#8217; important matter
which could not well wait.</p>

<p>Drew, however, was forced to wait seven minutes
by his watch. He chafed at the delay. He
crossed his legs at least once each leaden minute.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>He feared that the trail was getting cold.
Twice he rose, as if to go. Each time the secretary
had indicated patience by an arching of her
brows and a jerk of her thumb toward the
ground-glass door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send in Drew!&#8221; boomed as the door opened
and let out the caller. Drew strode in with his
notes in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a minute, Westlake,&#8221; he said, dropping
into a chair and leaning over the desk behind
which sat a good-natured official of the superior
order. &#8220;A minute! I&#8217;m in a jam! What
d&#8217;ye make of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew related his discovery in the booths of
the Grand Central. He went right to the point.
He explained the auger-hole, the shavings, and
the fact that it was the same set of booths to
which the call had been sent from the prison,
over the time Stockbridge had been slain.</p>

<p>Westlake listened with dawning light. He
leaned back as Drew finished talking. He
smiled. He thrust his thumbs under his vest.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a hardworking man, Drew,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but you didn&#8217;t get it all. Do you remember
the third call that I gave you this morning?&mdash;the
one when the chief-operator at Gramercy
Hill put the howler on? It was from the same
booths you just mentioned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly was. There&#8217;s no use looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>at the record. The number was 9844 Gramercy
Hill. In other words we have the evidence to
show that a thin, whispering voice called up
Stockbridge from one booth in the Grand Central
at the same time the prison was connected
to the adjacent booth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Mike!&#8221; said Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;your case grows interesting, Chief.
You&#8217;ve got a lot of tangled leads and all that,
but a little more work should untangle them. A
telephone engineer ought to make a crackerjack
detective. He&#8217;s trained to unsnarl the worst
snarls in the world. You ought to see some of
our wiring diagrams. It takes study to trace
them out. You&#8217;re learning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I am, Westlake. I think
that Morphy, up at the prison, has been &#8217;phoning
New York. I believe he has a confederate
in this town. This confederate, we will say, received
his instructions about midnight last
night. He bored a hole through the booths and
called up Stockbridge. But what was it all
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I can&#8217;t answer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rose from the chair and crammed his
notes in his inner, overcoat pocket. &#8220;What the
devil did they do that for?&#8221; he asked with flashing
eyes. &#8220;Morphy calls up Gramercy Hill 9843
at, or about, midnight. Gramercy Hill 9844
calls up Stockbridge. Stockbridge was killed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>by a bullet in the neck as he&#8217;s talking over the
&#8217;phone. Was the call to warn him? Was it to
threaten him? Was it to occupy his attention
so that the murderer could get in the room and
fire the shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find out how he got into the room?&#8221;
asked Westlake, leaning forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not! The whole thing gets weird.
I can&#8217;t sleep! I&#8217;m not going to sleep till I get
some light on this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look healthy,&#8221; said Westlake, as he
pressed the buzzer for the next caller.</p>

<p>Drew emerged from the elevator and hurried
to the street with short, quick strides. He
crossed the snow and pressed open the door
to a cigar store. He fished out a nickel and
called up his office.</p>

<p>To Harrigan who answered, he said tersely,
&#8220;Get Flynn up to the Grand Central! Get him
to the east-end telephone-booth, on the lower
level. Tell him I&#8217;ll be there. He&#8217;s back from
Morristown, isn&#8217;t he? He phoned, eh? Get
him to me! I need him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew hung up with a swift flip of the receiver.
He hurried to the subway station and
caught a local up-town. He had time to flash a
fourth and fifth set of photos before Flynn came
puffing across the lower level.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here!&#8221; snapped Drew, drawing the operative
into the middle booth. &#8220;Bend down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>there where that hole is, and tell me what you
see on the varnish.Footprints&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fingerprints, Chief. Two, three of
them. Looks like somebody pressed hard when
they drilled that hole. The outer print is a
good one of a thumb. Left thumb, I should
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! I&#8217;m going to find out who
made that impression, within one hour. You
stay here and grab anybody who tries to talk
with the prison. Frick is up there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about O&#8217;Toole, who&#8217;s watching
Nichols?&#8221; asked Flynn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave him stay on that assignment. I need
you here. Stick now! Watch everybody who
talks over these three phones. Arrest anybody
who receives or sends a call to the prison.
There&#8217;s plenty of Central Office men handy for
a pinch. Fosdick will back them up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rushed for the subway. He realized
that he had wasted valuable time by not taking
the complete set of fingerprint photos on his
first inspection of the booths. It was a detail
he had overlooked. But then, he could afford
to make mistakes. The men or man he was
after, dared not make any. This was a thing
he had often recalled in dealing with super-criminals.</p>

<p>Fosdick&#8217;s rooms at Detective Headquarters,
on Center Street, were luckily deserted as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>rushed down through the hallway. The Commissioner
widened his eyes as Drew handed
over the camera, with a request that the films
be developed and prints made within twenty
minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be done that soon,&#8221; said the detective.
&#8220;Give us fifty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it twenty-five!&#8221; shot Drew. &#8220;I
got lots to tell you, but it&#8217;ll keep. Get those
prints and we&#8217;ll land our man. The last two
films have perfect samples of finger-work. Our
man slipped there! He signed his own death
warrant!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Commissioner pressed a button. To the
young man who came, he explained the necessity
of rushing the developing and printing of
the films. He turned as the messenger hurried
out with the camera.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about that bullet?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as I said, Commissioner. It was
fired from a smooth-bore pistol or gun. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, maybe not! Sometimes there isn&#8217;t much
rifling on an old revolver. Those little twenty-two
affairs are made out of cast-iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the cupronickle bullet shows smokeless
powder and high-class criminal activity. I
doubt if one of those little rods would take a
modern steel-jacketed bullet. They&#8217;re used in
automatics.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>&#8220;But automatics have good rifling. That bullet
was as smooth as before it was shot. Here
it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosdick opened a drawer and pulled out a
later-day projectile of the lesser-caliber.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is smooth!&#8221; he repeated with heat.
&#8220;It was cut from the old millionaire&#8217;s brain.
It ain&#8217;t scratched. It never took the rifling it
was intended for. My theory is, that it was
fired from a gun of larger caliber. That is to
say, it didn&#8217;t fit the bore. A thirty-thirty rifle
might be used to hold a twenty-two caliber bullet.
It would not take the rifling of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s hardly possible,&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s too vague and doesn&#8217;t
suit me. We&#8217;re going to find that the deeper
we get in this thing, the simpler will be the explanation.
I remember any number of cases
which have been solved in this city where the
mystery was so wrapped up in speculation and
the improbable that our minds failed to grasp
the simple thing which was the solution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think the lack of rifling on the bullet
might be the opening wedge to catching the
man who shot Stockbridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It could well be, Fosdick. The lack of a
thing sometimes is just as important as the visible
clue. Do you remember the Rajah case at
Gramercy Park?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fosdick leaned back in his chair and stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>up at the ceiling. &#8220;Seems to me that I do,&#8221;
he said, thrusting out his lower lip. &#8220;There
was a big jewel missing. Sort of an Idol&#8217;s Eye
case&mdash;wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly! A white diamond was missing at
a dinner. Lights went out as they were passing
the stone around the table. Lights came on
again and the diamond was gone. Everybody
accused. A strange print was found on the sideboard.
Servants knew nothing about it. The
print didn&#8217;t correspond to any which we took
there. Seemed impossible and all that. Well,
the very fact that the print didn&#8217;t correspond
was the means of finding the stone and the culprit.
You remember it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vaguely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simple! A Lascar who waited on the table
slipped off his shoes, crept into the room, secured
the diamond and climbed to the sideboard
where he hid it on top of a picture. The thumbprint
which we puzzled our heads over was a
toe-print! We got the fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recall it now,&#8221; said Fosdick. &#8220;I think one
of our men thought out the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t!&#8221; declared the detective. &#8220;We
worked it out! The city department had given
up the case. This may be the same. I&#8217;ll venture
to say that as soon as you get a good operative
some private agency secures his services.
Now, Commissioner, confess up. What manner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>of gun could fire a bullet, such as a cupronickle
one, without leaving markings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Smooth bore. An old flint-lock&mdash;for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll grant that! They&#8217;re clumsy, however.
The shot which killed the millionaire was fired
at very close range through a smooth tube of a
greater caliber than the diameter of the bullet
found in his head. If it were fired through a
gun which was rifled, then there was a collar or
collars on the bullet, which we didn&#8217;t find. The
same thing was discovered by examination of
the shells which the Germans fired at Paris.
There was no rifling on those long-range projectiles.
The bands dropped off after the shell
left the gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then this bullet was fired at long range?&#8221;
Fosdick was openly incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Again we have the impossibility or
seeming impossibility. I examined that library,
both before and after the murder. No shot
could have been fired from the outside so that
a bullet would reach the old man. If that were
the case there would have been an opening in
the walls or at the windows or the ventilators.
Besides, we have the powder burns on the millionaire&#8217;s
head. We are squarely confronted
with a paradox. Riddle me that paradox and
we will go a long ways toward finding the man
who murdered Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>Fosdick frowned. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see it at all,&#8221; he
confessed. &#8220;I still hold to the theory that we
should third degree all of the servants. I&#8217;ve
got some of them. If they don&#8217;t squeal, I&#8217;ll get
the others!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at his watch. &#8220;Personally,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;m of the opinion that you will not get
anything out of them. I think it was a mistake
to arrest them. It would have been far better
to trail the butler and the doorman and see if
they connected with anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing this!&#8221; exclaimed Fosdick with
asperity. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got charge of this case, Drew.
I got charge and I don&#8217;t want any meddling.
I&#8217;ve my own methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the detective. &#8220;All right!
I want a check-up on the finger prints and then
I&#8217;ll be going. I had to come to you for this.
You have such an interesting collection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your answer!&#8221; said the commissioner,
rising and striding around the desk.
&#8220;Take this bullet and look it over. Put it in
your pocket. And<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned swiftly. The messenger stood
in the doorway. He came forward as Fosdick
nodded. He passed over the hastily developed
prints which Drew had taken. The commissioner
glanced at them, frowned, held them to
the light, then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try these on the Man Who Can&#8217;t Be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>Beat! He&#8217;s the best in the world. He&#8217;ll know
in three minutes who made these prints if the
fellow is on our records.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fingerprint expert nodded to Drew as
they entered a huge room which was lined with
mahogany cabinets in the manner of a filing
system in a mail-order house. Fosdick passed
the five photos into this man&#8217;s hand. He smiled
as the expert adjusted his glasses, pulled out a
pocket magnifying-glass, and leaned close up
to the prints.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re infallible!&#8221; exclaimed the Commissioner
with superiority. &#8220;Watch Pope get your
man. He&#8217;ll hound him out in no time. Eh,
Pope?&#8221;</p>

<p>The expert was not of a sanguine disposition
in the minute which ensued as he ran over the
prints, studied them, held them to the light then
laid them down on a table and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have no record of this fellow,&#8221; he said
coldly. &#8220;It looks like a man&#8217;s print. Here&#8217;s
the thumb and here is the middle finger of the
right hand, I think. Hard to tell, sometimes.
I&#8217;d say, as a pretty sure thing, that we have
no duplicates in our collection. Shall I look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Look!&#8221; said Fosdick.</p>

<p>Drew felt that the case was slipping from him
as Pope fluttered from cabinet to cabinet, pulled
out drawers, replaced them and tried still
others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>&#8220;No go?&#8221; he asked as the expert shot back
the last cross-index cabinet and turned with
shaking head. &#8220;No go? Try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely no record of the maker of these
prints,&#8221; said Pope, holding out the photos. &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t registered with us yet. Whoever made
these prints has never been arrested in the
United States for a felony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about a misdemeanor?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! They&#8217;re all in this cabinet. Even if
he was picked up on suspicion or for auto speeding
or beating his wife,&mdash;if he has one,&mdash;he
would be here. I&#8217;m sorry, inspector.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew pulled down the lapels of his black coat
and turned toward Fosdick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got a print of Finklestein?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;You remember the fellow who was arrested
in the Morphy case. He was afterwards
released for lack of evidence or else he claimed
exemption. I&#8217;ve forgotten how he got off. He&#8217;s
supposed to be in Florida or somewhere in the
South. I had a man out to Morristown who reports
along those lines. I wish you&#8217;d compare
these prints with Finklestein&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said the commissioner. &#8220;Go as
far as you like. I don&#8217;t think that there is anything
in these prints. You got the wrong ones&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Finkle&mdash;Finklestein&#8217;s initials?&#8221;
asked the expert.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>&#8220;J. B.,&#8221; said Drew quickly. &#8220;Julius B.!&#8221;</p>

<p>A quick search through an alphabet-index, a
consultation of two drawers, out of which the
expert pulled some tiny squares of cardboard,
and then a slow shaking of his head, brought
Drew back to where he had started from before
taking the prints in the booth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No record could be more different,&#8221; Pope
said. &#8220;Finklestein has a big hand and very
broad fingers. The fellow who made these
prints has a little hand with thin fingers. The
whorls and loops are entirely dissimilar. He
comes under classification 2-4-X. Finklestein is
in cabinet 2-9-0. They couldn&#8217;t be further
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew started out through the doorway with
Fosdick following him. They stood on the landing
leading to the downstairs steps, where the
detective was about to leave the commissioner
with a curt good-by. His hand was out when
he drew it back, dropped it to his side and
wheeled with sudden intuition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Are you and
I detectives or children? Come back to the
fingerprint room. Hurry now. I want to see
Pope. I forgot something!&#8221;</p>

<p>The expert rose as they entered. &#8220;Well?&#8221;
he asked with arching brows and a slight frown
on his face. &#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew pointed a finger as steady as a rifle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>He bared his eyes into Pope&#8217;s own. &#8220;Were
you up to Stockbridge&#8217;s house?&#8221; he asked
swiftly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you take prints and photos of everything
in the library? I understand that this
was done after I turned the case over to Commissioner
Fosdick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was done!&#8221; rasped Fosdick. &#8220;Of course
it was done. It&#8217;s always done when a case looks
like a homicide!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This case looked worse than that!&#8221; said
Drew. &#8220;It was slaughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>The commissioner turned to the fingerprint
man. &#8220;Where are the prints and photos you
took up at the house?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still in the developing room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they are developed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon know, sir,&#8221; he answered, pressing
a button.</p>

<p>The messenger entered who had attended to
Drew&#8217;s prints which the detective took in the
telephone-booth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get down to the developing room,&#8221; ordered
Pope. &#8220;Get me all the prints and positives of
Exhibit 12 of the Stockbridge case. Bring
what is already developed. Tell them to rush
the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three men waited in silence for the return
of the messenger. Drew paced the floor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>thoughtfully. He clasped and unclasped his
hands behind his back. He had almost slipped
in an important matter. It was a chance he was
taking, but a vital one in the case. The fingerprints
taken by the expert in the library might
and might not jibe with those taken in the slot-booth.
If they were the same, or any one was
the same, the case would offer a new line for
investigation.</p>

<p>A sliding footstep at the door announced the
messenger. He held a sheath of curling papers
in his hand. Pope reached and snatched
the photos. He ran over them with widening
eyes. He sorted them into two piles upon the
table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five prints!&#8221; he announced, glancing at
Drew with a sly smile. &#8220;Five of these prints
are the same as your set. In other words, the
man who made the impressions in the telephone-booth
was also in the library at or about the
time of the murder!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; snorted Fosdick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Photos don&#8217;t lie. Now
we&#8217;re getting there! That&#8217;s the first light I&#8217;ve
seen in some time. It clears the case of the
supernatural. It puts it where it belongs&mdash;in
the material world of flesh and blood and hate
and revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does that!&#8221; corroborated the expert, siding
with Drew. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he added good-naturedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help out some more. I&#8217;ve got a
book of notations made in the library. I spent
two hours there this morning. I flashed every
print I could see. There&#8217;s some of the butler
on the bottle and the tray. There&#8217;s a number
on the polished table. There are at least six on
the door knob, to say nothing of the smashed
panel. I suppose yours is among them, inspector?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew held out his right hand. &#8220;Look and
see,&#8221; he suggested with a short laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
never been printed in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be necessary. These three
prints which correspond with the ones you took
in the booth, settle the matter. There&#8217;s no record
of this fellow in our cabinet. But&mdash;he was
in that library!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did he leave his prints?&#8221; asked
Drew.</p>

<p>Pope consulted a page of his note book. He
thumbed over another page, thrust his finger
between the sheet and turned to the photos.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the number on the back of that one?&#8221;
he asked, nodding toward the topmost photograph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten,&#8221; said Drew, turning it over and studying
a penciled number.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten,&#8221; repeated the expert. &#8220;That is a print
which was flashed on the corner of the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>table which was overturned when Stockbridge
fell to the floor after being shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the same man made it who made my
prints in the booth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same!&#8221; declared the expert dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see where you two are getting,&#8221;
said Fosdick. &#8220;How could a man get into that
library, shoot the old millionaire, get out again
and go over to a slot-booth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might have been in the slot-booth first,&#8221;
suggested Drew with slow smiling. &#8220;From the
booth he went to the house and killed Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is established,&#8221; exclaimed Pope,
&#8220;that the man you are after was in the library
and in the booth. That&#8217;s all you can say.
There&#8217;s no way to determine the exact hour
these two sets of prints were made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew lifted a second print. &#8220;No. sixteen,&#8221;
he said, turning to the expert. &#8220;Where was
that made?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pope consulted his book. He glanced up at
Fosdick, who was ill at ease over the development
in the case. &#8220;That,&#8221; he said, swinging
his eyes till they met Drew&#8217;s, &#8220;that was made
on the hardwood floor directly under Stockbridge&#8217;s
body. We found the print, with others
of the little finger and middle finger when the
coroner moved the corpse!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective stared at Pope. &#8220;You mean,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>he said shrewdly, &#8220;that the man who made the
prints in the booth and on the little table, also
was down on his knees arranging Stockbridge&#8217;s
body, or doing something like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made a distinct impression on the floor
despite the fact that the body was moved over
it. The polish and the varnish helped to hold
this impression. I venture to say that it is there
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;I may have a look at
it. I never went after prints in my investigation.
I left that to men who knew their business&mdash;like
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pope smiled. He glanced at his book for a
third time. &#8220;What&#8217;s the number of that last
print?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-four!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taken from the edge of the heavy door
which was broken down by Delaney, I guess.
Looks like his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a hand in that,&#8221; admitted Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;This print was close to the knob. There&#8217;s
none like it on the knob itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Umph!&#8221; declared Fosdick.</p>

<p>Drew glanced at the commissioner. He
smiled as he laid his hand on Fosdick&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you to thank,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for
letting me use the brains and facilities of the
police department. I think it clears the case
in a remarkable manner.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked the commissioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well for one thing,&#8221; Drew said, lifting the
third photo. &#8220;For one thing, we know that
our man passed through the doorway before or
after the murder. He was in the library. He
was in that booth which is a half mile or more
away from the mansion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll grant you that, but what does it prove?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew laid the photo on the table and turned
toward the doorway. &#8220;It proves,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that Stockbridge was murdered by a man who
was never arrested in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a large order!&#8221; chuckled the commissioner.
&#8220;There are a few good citizens and
a number of bad ones we haven&#8217;t got&mdash;yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8221; said the detective, pulling his
hat down over his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to look
for a man who is too clever for his own good.
He&#8217;s stayed out of your clutches. He&#8217;s forgotten
more about telephones than most men know.
He&#8217;s as slippery as an eel and as clever as the
very devil. In one thing only did he err, so far
in this chase.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the commissioner.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t wear gloves on the job. That&#8217;s
where we may trip him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all forget something,&#8221; said Fosdick,
as Drew hurried out through the door with a
bow toward the staring fingerprint man.</p>

<p>The detective hurried down the steps,&mdash;passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>the sergeant at the entrance, and turned
up his coat collar as he plunged from the building
and lowered his head beneath the down driving
snow. The entire matter was as he had told
Delaney. He would have to find who made the
prints!</p>

<p>Deep, drifted snow barred his progress as he
struck down through a towering cañon and
walked eastward. He had no coherent idea save
the one that he wanted the grip of the open
places in his lungs and the feel of freedom from
stifling rooms and skeptical men.</p>

<p>The case had resolved itself into a battle of
wits wherein the culprit who had murdered
Stockbridge, by unknown means, had all the advantages.
He was unknown. He had the largest
city in the world to hide himself in. He
could strike at any time and in any quarter.
Also, the detective realized, with a chilly oath,
the murderer might already be fleeing the city
for the south or west. It would be a natural
thing for him to do.</p>

<p>Drew had one undisputed qualification for a
detective. He was a worker. He lacked the
Latin sense of deduction, or the cleverness of a
great operative who secured his men through
quick brain work and shrewdness.</p>

<p>Hard work, and more work and still more
work had won for him the little position he held
in the city. He did not overrate his own powers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>He had failed too often to hold himself
too highly. Chance was a big factor in the criminal
game. The members of the criminal tribe
worked through luck and sheer audacity. Many
escaped from the net and moved in the underworld
until they made their final mistake which
was probably so glaring it couldn&#8217;t be overlooked.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the finger prints were
not of record, Drew held to the swirling conviction
that the man he was after was of the criminal
horde. There was much to lead him to this
belief. The cleverness in connecting up the two
telephone booths&mdash;the warning through the mail
to Stockbridge&mdash;the manner in which the murder
had been covered up in a score of details,
all pointed to a criminal mind of the cunningest
order. It savored of practice in crime and
study of natural conditions. Its bizarre features
placed it out from other crimes and raised
it to a class of its own.</p>

<p>The snow which impeded the detective&#8217;s
steps, in some manner cleared his brain. He
began to review the series of events. He boxed
the case with returning shrewdness. He went
over the points like a sailor repeating the compass-chart.
He even saw a light.</p>

<p>This light was a star that guided him around
a corner and then along the long reach of a
white-mantled street where children shrilled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>and played. Snow-balls flew past his head.
Sleighs and muffled taxis churned by. Women
in furs and heavy cloaks glanced up at his olive
face from which peered sanguine eyes bent upon
a known destination.</p>

<p>He paused at the foot of a flight of steps
leading to a library. In this building he knew
there would be on file certain data concerning
three links of the chain which he was trying to
forge about the criminal or criminals who had
slain Stockbridge.</p>

<p>He entered the storm-door, shook the snow
from his coat, and removed his hat with a
swinging bow as he drew erect in front of a
prim lady at a desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want all the books you have on modern
telephony,&#8221; he said with a winning smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure that you have one or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prim lady who knew a gentleman when
she saw one, raised her brows and rapidly
thumbed over a filing-card system.</p>

<p>&#8220;One or two,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Why, we have
over twenty. Now just what branch of Telephony
do you want? There are a number of
divisions in the subject. We have Smith on
Central Office practice. We have Steinward on
Induced Currents in Relation to Magnetism.
We have Oswerlander on Switchboards and
Carbon Transmitters. We have Burke on Circuits
and Batteries. We have<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;Hold on, please,&#8221; said Drew, catching his
breath. &#8220;I better try something easy. One of
those Juvenile books with simple diagrams and
switchboards or junction-boxes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew carried the book to an alcove which
was deserted. He took off his coat, hung it on
the back of a chair, upended his hat and sat
down with a tired smile. Soon he was busy in
the mystery of electricity in relation to the
telephone. He conned over the pages. He
browsed along like a novice trying to understand
trigonometry. He frowned over such
terms as micro-ampere and micro-volt. He
grew dizzy following wiring diagrams which
were far worse than any clue he had ever attempted.</p>

<p>&#8220;A telephone engineer,&#8221; he said half aloud.
&#8220;A man who could trace out this stuff ought to
make a mighty fine detective. I never saw such
a snarl. Now what does hysteresis and laminations
mean? What&#8217;s the idea of having an alternating
current of low voltage on the same
line with a talking current of three volts? I
don&#8217;t see how they can get two currents on one
set of wires. Maybe they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tossed the book to the table in front of
him and rose with a frown. This frown changed
to a wrinkled furrow of half amusement as he
hurried back to the little prim lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too deep for me,&#8221; he said, referring to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>book she had given him. &#8220;That may be a beginner&#8217;s
treatise, but I&#8217;m in the kindergarten
class in electricity. What&#8217;s a micro-volt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look it up, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. I wouldn&#8217;t know, after you
did. Suppose you get me a book on magpies.&#8221;</p>

<p>The librarian fingered her files. &#8220;Try Birds
of England,&#8221; she suggested, coming from behind
her desk and gliding like a pale shadow
over to a book-case. &#8220;Try this. It&#8217;s complete.
You&#8217;ll find magpies and starlings and piemags
and any number of plates of six colors in this
splendid volume.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one that interested me was black as a
crow,&#8221; he said, as he turned toward his alcove.
&#8220;Perhaps there are white magpies as well as
white crows. I never saw one, though. My
bird&#8217;s a deep one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little librarian stared after Drew&#8217;s vanishing
form with a slight pucker between her
eyes. For a man of his solid respectability, the
series of actions were strange indeed. She sat
down and wondered if he was a moving picture
editor trying to connect black magpies and telephones.</p>

<p>Drew appeared in two minutes. He leaned
over the desk and startled the lady with a request
for anything pertaining to guns and projectiles.
These she had in plenty. A great many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>war books had been purchased during the period
which followed America&#8217;s declaration.</p>

<p>The detective erected a breastwork with the
books she brought. He conned them with understanding
until he came to ballistics and trajectory.
He stopped there. He rose. His brain
was crammed with fact upon fact. He had the
formulæ of smokeless powder and the analysis
of cupronickle bullets. He had absorbed muzzle
velocity and angle of fire. He fairly bubbled
over with good humor as he thrust his
hands into his overcoat, caught up his hat and
started out the door after glancing back and
bowing to the librarian who smiled a good-by.</p>

<p>The street was dark save for the glow of the
overhead arcs. He thrust out his arm and
tested the snow fall. It was not as heavy as
when he had entered the library. He went down
the steps, turned toward the north and plowed
along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought came to him to glance at
his watch. He had forgotten time and place
over the hours in the pursuit of knowledge
which might and might not be applied to the
case at hand. It was almost six o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord,&#8221; he said in surprise. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
crazy. Two hours in a trance. Now for work.
I wonder what the operatives will have to report?
They ought to have something. I wonder,&#8221;
he added, peering under the fine drizzle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>of snow, &#8220;I wonder where the nearest telephone
is located? Another block, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>His brain gathered up the skeins of the case
as he hurried along. Fingerprints, plaster-casts,
smooth bullets, locked rooms and a raven-black
magpie, trooped into their proper formation.
He dwelt longest on the telephone information
he had gathered in the library. The
case seemed bound up in whispering wires and
broken connections which might be spliced together
with patience and hard work.</p>

<p>The whole matter, from the call of the millionaire,
down to the clew discovered in comparing
the finger prints at Detective Headquarters,
was a city-spread network of telephone
connections which had to be traced back to an
elusive individual who flitted like a shadow or
a whirling dervish across the detective&#8217;s vision.</p>

<p>He reached the drug-store, paused outside,
glanced up and down the white-robed street,
then pressed the door open and stamped inside.
He found a nickel. Dropping this in the slot
and closing the booth, he asked Central for his
office phone.</p>

<p>The connection was made with Harrigan on
the other end. &#8220;What&#8217;s new in the Stockbridge
case?&#8221; asked Drew in a whisper.</p>

<p>He listened. He grew rigid as the faithful
operative summed up the entire series of reports.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>There were six of them. The last was
from Delaney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang up!&#8221; the detective almost shouted in
his eagerness. &#8220;Hang up, Harrigan, and let me
get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finding a quarter instead of a nickel, Drew
dropped it in the large slot and jiggled the receiver&#8217;s
hook until Central answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me Gramercy Hill 9764!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;Quick! 9764 Gramercy Hill!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her number,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;Loris
Stockbridge&#8217;s number. It must be her number.
I haven&#8217;t forgotten that, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>The time consumed in getting the connection
seemed endless. Drew lifted one damp sole
from the floor of the booth and then the other.
The receiver&#8217;s diaphragm clicked finally.
&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Hello, who&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited a full second. &#8220;This Delaney?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;Who?&#8221; he added. &#8220;Oh! you&#8217;re the
maid! Well get me Miss Stockbridge or Mr.
Delaney. Yes, Delaney. D-e-l-a-n-e-y!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This Delaney? ... No! ... Who?... Nichols? ... Harry Nichols? Hello, Nichols! ... Is Delaney there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The big operative&#8217;s voice sounded with a rasp
on the wire. &#8220;What&#8217;s the news?&#8221; asked Drew.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve been telling Harrigan?
Something about a coffin? A coffin? What&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>casket? A hardwood casket. I&#8217;ll be right up!
I&#8217;m coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective&#8217;s olive face was the color of
burnt pottery as he flipped the receiver on the
hook, thrust his knee against the door and
charged out of the booth and into the drug-store.
He wheeled, turned his coat collar up,
drew down his hat and dashed outside as an astonished
clerk leaned over the prescription
counter and stared after him.</p>

<p>The message that Delaney had sent over the
snow-crusted wires, and along the underground
conduits, was laden with menace. It drove Drew
westward through the drifts like a man who had
a whip held over him. He crossed two avenues
before he sighted a taxi. He charged after this,
sprang to the running board, and shouted into
the driver&#8217;s muffled ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive like sin&mdash;full speed and more&mdash;up
Fifth Avenue! I&#8217;ll tell you when to stop! The
devils are not going to kill that little lady if
I can help it,&#8221; he added, as he opened the door
and climbed inside the taxi.</p>

<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE CLOSING NET&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Night was falling upon the greatest city
in the world. After night would come
the myriads of electric lights in the huge
Broadway signs&mdash;the surface cars creeping
through the snow-fall like glow worms&mdash;the
muffled pedestrians and the chain-tired taxis,
with their well-groomed patrons, hastening to
ballrooms, cabarets and theaters more luxurious
than any dreamed of by Lucullus.</p>

<p>Into the tide of this forming stream of wealth,
Drew&#8217;s taxi turned and ground northward
through the drifts. The detective had given no
definite address. He wanted the air of the Avenue
for at least two blocks, before he reached
the Stockbridge mansion. He signaled as a
familiar corner came in view. He turned his
overcoat collar up to his chin and stepped out,
as the driver brought the taxi to a slow stop
at the curb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay around the corner!&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;Stay, till I send word. Here&#8217;s a dollar for
supper. Get that and wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver touched his cap and reached for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>the bill. Drew swung northward, threw back
his head, and plowed along the snow-laden sidewalk.
Delaney&#8217;s statement over the telephone
had stirred every drop of red blood in his body.
Loris was in danger! This nerved him on. He
clenched his gloved fists as he reached the first
side street. He crossed the wheel-churned snow,
with his lips gripped in a hard white line. His
eyes raised in heavy-lidded scrutiny of the towering
turrets and spires of the mansion. Lights
shone from its windows as if in defiance to the
powers of darkness which encompassed the
dwelling.</p>

<p>A snow-crusted form stepped out from a basement
shelter. Drew raised his arm as a barrier
when a figure of a man lurched in his direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, O&#8217;Toole!&#8221; he blurted, recognizing the
operative. &#8220;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Toole jerked a mittened finger in the direction
of the mansion. &#8220;Our lad&#8217;s in there,&#8221; he
said, thrashing his arms and flipping his finger
for a second time. &#8220;Harry Nichols!&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;S&mdash;o! The whole case seems to be gathering
again. Every clue leads this way now.
What did you learn to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>O&#8217;Toole yawned. &#8220;I got on the job early,&#8221;
he said with frosty breath. &#8220;I waited. The lad
came down. He got in a taxi and I&#8217;m right
after him. First he went to the Quartermaster&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>Offices at the Battery. Then he went to
Governor&#8217;s Island. From there I trailed him
to the Red Cross Headquarters. He &#8217;phoned
Gramercy Hill 9764, at least three times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the girl in the case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep, Chief! He&#8217;s gone on her. He tended
to some funeral matters connected with Stockbridge,
bought some flowers&mdash;three dozen lilies
of the valley&mdash;then came on up here. I&#8217;ve been
waiting a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen anybody about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney and some Central Office men&mdash;that&#8217;s
all! Shall I stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here! Jump back in the alley and
watch the junction-box. I think Delaney has
been there. You&#8217;ll find the snow melted in
spots. Plant somewhere, and keep your eyes
open. Grab anybody you see tampering with
the wires to the house. I&#8217;m looking for trouble
to-night. They threatened Loris with a letter
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew did not stop to explain. He hurried on
ahead of O&#8217;Toole, turned at the iron-grilled
gate, passed through and pressed the button.</p>

<p>A Central Office man with a gold-badge showing,
jerked the door open and glanced out. He
blinked sagely as he recognized the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Let me in!&#8221;</p>

<p>The door swung wider. Drew lunged through
and turned. &#8220;What&#8217;s new?&#8221; he asked, pointing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>a thumb over his shoulder. &#8220;Are those servants
still under arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them, Inspector,&#8221; grunted the Central
Office man. &#8220;I can&#8217;t talk much. Fosdick
gave me hell for talking to a newspaper man.
He left word, though, that you could come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; Drew said dryly. &#8220;Thanks!
That&#8217;s kind of him. You are holding down this
door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Inspector! The butler and the second-man
are down at Headquarters. I don&#8217;t like
the job, but orders is orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew loosened his overcoat, removed his kid-gloves,
stamped his snow-covered shoes on the
rug, and hurried past the library, where stood
a burly Central Office man on guard. He
mounted the steps with the running motion of
a boy of fifteen. He glanced upward to where
velvet-soft light glowed at the entrance to
Loris Stockbridge&#8217;s suite of rooms. Delaney
stood framed in the opening. His huge bulk
blotted out the inner rooms. His face, seen in
the high shadows, was long and grim.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in there,&#8221; said the operative, raising
his chin over his lifted arm. &#8220;Miss Stockbridge
is in there. She&#8217;s with her maid&mdash;one Fosdick
tried to pinch&mdash;and Harry Nichols. She&#8217;s got
a notice by special delivery, that the coffin she
ordered from the Hardwood Casket Company,
of Jersey City, will be delivered to-morrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>She never ordered any coffin, Chief. Ain&#8217;t that
dirt&mdash;to a girl like that? What d&#8217;ye think of
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew&#8217;s answer to Delaney&#8217;s question was a
grinding of teeth and a sharp oath of defiance.
He clutched the operative&#8217;s arm in a nipping
grip. He led him into the tiny reception-hall
of the suite.</p>

<p>The detective paused on the threshold of a
larger room. He dropped his hand from Delaney&#8217;s
arm. He stabbed sharp glances here
and there about the interior. He widened his
eyes as they came to rest upon a further doorway,
which was hung with soft tapestries gathered
to the side-walls by cords of silk. Beyond
this doorway, like the vista of some rare painting,
shone an inner light of a woman&#8217;s shrine.</p>

<p>Silver and pearl and old rose blended into a
bower such as is found in palaces. Tiny medallions
and plaques and miniatures&mdash;narrow
framed studies in oil&mdash;fans, vases, statuettes of
ivory and rare china, a hundred choice and
dainty objects of haute-art were in that splendid
room.</p>

<p>Drew advanced over a rug so soft and deep he
felt like a peri entering Paradise. He brushed
aside the tapestries and strode swiftly forward.
His hat came off as Loris advanced to meet him
from a large chamber, wherein the color scheme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>had been worked out in black and white with a
suggestion of green-in-gold.</p>

<p>He forgot the material things of that apartment
as he bowed gallantly. He thrust his hand
forward and clasped strong fingers over her
own. The grief of her father&#8217;s death had
widened her eyes and set them in circles of
dark brows and tear-stained features. Her
voice clutched in her throat as she tried to speak.
Her hand was drawn from his slowly. It raised
to her broad forehead beneath her blue-black
hair, with a passing motion that dispelled some
of the doubt within her. She smiled wanly.
Her round, young breast rose and fell with the
rustle of perfumed laces. She swished her lavender
gown behind her with a turn of a white,
supple wrist upon which was a tiny, diamond-studded
watch of superior make.</p>

<p>&#8220;Courage!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Have courage!
They won&#8217;t get you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&mdash;they,&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;They have
threatened me like they threatened poor father.
They sent a letter. Oh, I wish I were a man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew flushed beneath his olive cheeks. He
reached upward and turned down his overcoat
collar. He laid his hat on a chair, braced his
shoulders, and stared around the room. His
eyes wandered from the walls to the inner opening.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s in there?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry&mdash;Harry Nichols. I telephoned for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>him. I was afraid. I admit I&#8217;m afraid, Mr.
Drew. You know what they did to father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. It was an error on my part.
We did not take the proper precautions. But
this time&mdash;we will!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you do. I don&#8217;t feel like myself,
after last night. It came so suddenly. I heard
you people talking in the lower hallway. I went
to the bannisters and saw all the servants at
the library door. And then&mdash;and then, I went
down without a particle of warning. It was a
shock, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One I could have spared you,&#8221; admitted the
detective. &#8220;It was preventable,&#8221; he added,
turning toward Delaney.</p>

<p>The operative stepped forward. He struck a
chair with his foot and tumbled it over. Picking
it up and setting it down on its legs, he flushed
guiltily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; snapped Drew. &#8220;Get me that
letter this young lady received from Jersey. Get
it! We&#8217;ll look it over right now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney glanced at Loris. &#8220;She&#8217;s got it,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I gave it back to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris shuddered and pressed her hands to
her breast. &#8220;I tore it up,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I
was so excited and angry I tore it up. It&#8217;s
in the waste-basket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fetch the basket!&#8221; said Drew to Delaney.
&#8220;Go get it. We&#8217;ll make this room our headquarters,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>he added, swinging about on one
heel. &#8220;We&#8217;ll stay right here and watch things,
Miss Loris.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nodded prettily. Her courage came
back with flushed cheeks. She glanced up at
Drew&#8217;s strong jaw and face. The detective
squared his shoulder with a final shrug. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stay here!&#8221; he said masterly. &#8220;Though all the
demons in hell are closing in on you, we&#8217;ll
stick. We&#8217;ll get them this time! I&#8217;ve almost
got my man. If he moves his pawns to-night,
we&#8217;ll round up the whole bunch and send them
to the chair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there more than one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! One is directing&mdash;another or others
are doing his will. Your father was slain in
some mysterious manner which we have not, as
yet, determined. The man, or men, who caused
him to meet with death, left their marks behind
them&mdash;fingerprints&mdash;footprints, voices over
wires, and other evidences of material deviltry.
They blundered a score of times! They should
have killed that magpie. They did not wear
gloves when they should have worn gloves.
They forgot, or overlooked, that telephone calls
can be traced. We&#8217;ve traced them. We&#8217;ve almost
succeeded. The trouble is, that time is
short. What was in that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris turned toward the inner room. Delaney,
followed by Harry Nichols in full uniform,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>appeared. The operative held out a handful of
scrapped paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t much to learn here, Chief. It&#8217;s pretty
well torn up. I remember what it said, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was from the Hardwood Casket Company
of Jersey City. It was dated this morning. It
said that the coffin Miss Stockbridge ordered for
the lady who was about to die in her family,
would be delivered to-morrow afternoon by express
at her town house, as ordered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The curs!&#8221; exclaimed Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they are, Chief. The letter was signed
by the manager. I think it was the manager. I
couldn&#8217;t read his writing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see the scraps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney sorted them into a small stack and
passed them to Drew. The detective lifted each
fragment, held it to the light, and placed it into
his right overcoat-pocket. &#8220;I get it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It looks genuine. Did you telephone them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope! I was a-waiting for you to come up
here. There&#8217;s a phone here. It&#8217;s over there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew nodded. &#8220;I saw it,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.
&#8220;We better be careful how we use the
phones of this house. They tapped the wires
before, and they can do it again. We&#8217;re fighting
very high-class devils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem real!&#8221; blurted Harry Nichols.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>&#8220;I thought that death only stalked in No
Man&#8217;s Land. It&#8217;s right here, gentlemen!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew frowned and shook his head. He
glanced at Miss Stockbridge. He rubbed his
hands softly. &#8220;No more danger,&#8221; he warned
in a confident voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got twenty Central
Office men in the house or about the place.
No bank was ever better protected. There will
be no real trouble to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you said the other time, to father,&#8221;
Loris suggested without thought. &#8220;You
did&mdash;you remember? You were in the library
and he felt so confident nothing would happen.
Something did happen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit it!&#8221; Drew said with candor, &#8220;I
admit everything, Miss Loris. I&#8217;m partly to
blame. The trouble was, I underestimated my
adversary. A man should never do that. This
time, though,&#8221; he added with glazed eyes that
roamed the walls. &#8220;This time is going to be
different. Now, how about all your rooms? We
must be sure that there is no slip. We must
be sure<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, we must be sure!&#8221; interrupted Delaney.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve looked everywhere, Chief. Leave
that to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at Loris, who had stepped toward
Harry Nichols. He studied the picture the
two made, with their heads close together. The
captain held himself defiantly, but with that certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>polish which goes with a fondness for the
things of life worth having. He had chosen a
rather pretty girl, and upon her he had lavished
his attentions. He had defied Stockbridge! This
was motive enough for a crime. He was not
the criminal, decided Drew. There was that to
the captain&#8217;s resolute, though thick lips, and his
wide eyes, which assured the detective he would
not stoop to low things to gain his ends. He
had enlisted voluntarily. He had worked hard
at Plattsburg. He had served, and was upon
the eve of going to Pershing. No man with
such a record would slay a girl&#8217;s father to gain
the girl.</p>

<p>The detective erased Harry Nichols from his
mind. &#8220;You two,&#8221; he said commandingly, &#8220;had
better go into the library! I mean Miss Stockbridge&#8217;s
writing-room. Stay there, please, till
Mr. Delaney and I notify you. Who else, beside
we four, are in this part of the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the maid,&#8221; said Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go in, please, and wait. I&#8217;m going to lock
everything up. We&#8217;re going to take every precaution
this time. Frankly, I don&#8217;t see how any
agency can do more than we have already. Were
we dealing with ordinary crooks or blackmailers,
I would have you take a taxi and move to
some Fifth Avenue hotel. But it seems an unnecessary
risk. This is the safest place in the
world, despite the letter from the casket company
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>and the former warning. What man can
enter this place to-night&mdash;without our permission?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see one!&#8221; blurted Delaney.</p>

<p>Harry Nichols offered his arm to Loris. They
passed from the view of the two detectives with
the locked, gliding stride of two dancers who
moved to slow time. Drew heard the portières
which led to the writing-room rustle downward
and settle into place. He passed his hand over
his forehead and breathed deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get busy,&#8221; he whispered tersely.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll search these rooms again. Let&#8217;s start
with a definite foundation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney grunted at the uselessness of this as
he reached and took the detective&#8217;s overcoat
which was peeled off and extended to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it on a chair,&#8221; said Drew sharply.
&#8220;Over there with my hat. Now,&#8221; he snapped,
&#8220;what about the windows of this room, the little
reception hall and the bedroom over there?
That&#8217;s a bedroom, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief! I frisked it good. The Central
Office men were up here early in the morning.
They went through everything. Fosdick,
they say, was like a bull. He said the thing
couldn&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>was</i> done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get any clue, Chief, as to how it
was done?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s as much a mystery as ever. But we&#8217;re
trimming the tree called Truth with a broad
ax. I&#8217;m going around this case to get the man
or men who did it. Then we&#8217;ll find out how it
was done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Delaney&#8217;s expression was thought-laden.
&#8220;Just thought of it, Chief. I got them
plaster-of-paris casts. I got &#8217;em down stairs.
It was some job, believe me. I took everything
about that junction-box, after I&#8217;d thawed the
snow with hot blankets which a good-looking
cook brought to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go down and get them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney hurried out through the tapestries of
the room. Drew started his search of the apartment
by a study of the windows and the catches.
He opened one and glanced outside. Snow had
drifted to the depth of three inches on the sill.
This snow was unmarked. He examined all of
the sills extending from the three rooms. He
closed and locked the windows. He backed off
into the center of the reception room and studied
the situation from every angle. The furniture
was fragile and in sets of such splendid periods
his eyes closed over them. The rugs and tapestries&mdash;curtains
and portières&mdash;sheathings of
yellow hand-painted silk from Nippon&mdash;rare
ceramics and cloisonnés&mdash;a huge peach-blow
vase of the Ming dynasty and a hundred little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>jade and jasper knick-knacks were the outward
evidence of wealth.</p>

<p>He opened the plate-glass cases and peered inside.
He crawled under a couch and backed out
dusting his hands. He tapped with slow
knuckles a long cheval-glass by the side of
which was a tiny gold-bracket and a silver-plated
telephone. He went the rounds of the walls,
lifting pictures, portraits and little military
oils by French painters of the Franco-Prussian
period. He found nothing to excite his suspicion!</p>

<p>Entering a simple bedroom, with its tiled flooring
and its single white bed, he spared this
as he passed to the bath beyond, which had no
outlet save a ventilating shaft securely barred
by a bronze grating of close, fantastic-scrolled
mesh.</p>

<p>Delaney&#8217;s heavy steps were heard in the reception
hall as Drew finished. Striding out into
the larger room he frowned as the operative
deposited a blanket upon a Persian rug and began
to untie its corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got &#8217;em here, Chief,&#8221; explained the assistant
with upturned face. &#8220;There&#8217;s five or six
prints&mdash;all alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Repeat that!&#8221; Drew dropped to
one knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. There&#8217;s only been one guy at
that junction-box before the freezing started.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>He made plenty of tracks. He came and went
from the fence to the box. It&#8217;s a small foot.
There was plenty of prints made after the snow
piled on top of these little prints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The operatives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, and the Central Office bunch! But
these prints I got here are the only ones under
the snow. They stuck up when I melted away
the surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney offered a plaster-cast of the top of
a footprint. It was roughly done. It had been
made, like the others in the blanket, by pouring
cold plaster within a retaining bulge of soap.
The plaster had hardened and brought out each
detail. Drew traced his finger over the toe.
&#8220;Right foot,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s see the others!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a left foot, Delaney,&#8221; added the detective
slowly. &#8220;Only one left and four right.
That might happen. You didn&#8217;t take them all.
Well, bundle them up and plant them somewhere.
Put them under that couch, out of sight.
I&#8217;ve got an idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Chief?&#8221; asked the operative as
he drew on the knots until he had gathered the
corners together. &#8220;What&#8217;s new? I can&#8217;t see
anything in sight, at-tall, at-tall. One man&mdash;that&#8217;s
all I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s <i>all</i> I see&mdash;the trouble-hunter&mdash;Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>&#8220;But what about the tall guy who looked like
a German? The fellow the trouble-man saw
getting over the fence and beating it for Fifth
Avenue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t leave any tracks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Chief, get out! That ain&#8217;t human!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew paced the floor with his hands clasped
behind him. He wheeled with sudden energy.
&#8220;Go, you!&#8221; he exclaimed with a pointing finger.
&#8220;Hurry out of this house and telephone
Gramercy Hill Exchange. Tell the superintendent
to send over that trouble-man. I want to
compare these prints with his shoes. He couldn&#8217;t
have been lying. There&#8217;s no object in that!
But, Delaney, how could a man tap in on that
junction-box and never leave prints in the snow?
That&#8217;s my question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could one shoot a man in a sealed room,
Chief? There ain&#8217;t much difference!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew snatched out his watch. &#8220;Hurry,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Get over to Gramercy Hill Exchange&mdash;it&#8217;s
only three blocks from here. Ask Jack
Nefe, or whoever is in charge, for the trouble-man
who fixed the phone last night. He&#8217;ll be
able to tell us what part of the fence the tall
fellow, who looked like a German, got over.
Perhaps he wasn&#8217;t at the junction-box at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The tall fellow! Perhaps he was skulking
about the windows at the back.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>&#8220;Perhaps he was a ghost,&#8221; said Delaney to
himself as he lunged through the tapestries
toward the staircase which led down from the
third floor of the mansion.</p>

<p>Drew crossed the room and rapped softly on
a panel by the portières which covered the opening
to the reading-room and library. He heard
a muffled word of warning. Loris Stockbridge
glided across the rugs and peered out. Her
face was set and tear-stained. She had been
sobbing upon an olive-drab shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon,&#8221; said Drew with a slight sigh. &#8220;I
beg pardon, Miss Stockbridge. I want to look
over the sitting-room and examine the windows.
Where is the maid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris touched her eyes with a handkerchief
drawn from her breast. She replaced this and
nodded over her shoulder. She parted the portières
with her unjeweled right hand. &#8220;The
maid,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;is in her room. That&#8217;s
back of this reading-room. Shall I call her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Mr. Nichols come in here, please,&#8221;
said Drew. &#8220;I&#8217;ll knock on the maid&#8217;s door and
look her over. We can&#8217;t be too careful&mdash;remember
that. It&#8217;s getting late,&#8221; he added with candor.</p>

<p>Drew allowed Harry Nichols and Loris to
pass him as he held the portières for them with
a thoughtful bow. He crossed the reading-room,
examined the books and cases, glanced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>under a low divan, and saw to it that each window
was latched before he knocked lightly upon
a further door which was hidden by curtains.</p>

<p>A maid appeared, in smart white apron and
pursed lips of inquiry. Drew regarded her not
unkindly. He ran his eyes up and down her
trim figure from the black bow in her brown
hair to the wide ribbons which laced her trim
French shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been with Miss Stockbridge?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p><i>&#8220;Merci, Monsieur!&#8221;</i> she courtesied. &#8220;It has
been for zee longest time. <i>Cinq&mdash;sept, années,
monsieur,&#8221;</i> she counted mentally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Drew closing the door lightly.
&#8220;Good little girl. We won&#8217;t bother you the
rest of the night,&#8221; he added as he turned a good
key in a perfectly good lock and dropped the
curtains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; he said with a final glance about
the reading-room, with its morocco-bound tomes
and glowing lights. &#8220;Now, let the worst come!
Let that come what may!&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode through to the reception room,
glanced slit-lidded at Loris and Nichols, who
had seated themselves in the deeper recess of a
splendid alcove, and hurried to the hall where
Delaney was hastily removing his coat, and
showing other evidences of some answer to his
quest at the telephone exchange.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked Drew as the bulk of the big
operative loomed through the tapestries. &#8220;Well,
what did you find out over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough, Chief!&#8221; Delaney&#8217;s voice was hard.
He glanced at Loris and Nichols. His right eye
closed in a warning wink of caution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into this other room,&#8221; said Drew.
&#8220;Come right in, Delaney. This way!&#8221; Drew
lifted the portières, then dropped them after the
operative had stumbled forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you find?&#8221; he asked into Delaney&#8217;s
ear. &#8220;Out with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative glanced about the reading-room.
He blinked at the glowing electrics. He
recovered his voice as he drew in a deep breath
which bulged his chest to barrel proportions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went,&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;I went to Gramercy
Hill Exchange. Found the superintendent.... Fellow, you told me to find, Chief ... I
draws him to one side.... I asked about this
trouble-hunter.... He ups like I&#8217;d hit him.... He says fellow quit
to-day.... Says fellow.... Says he was no good.... Says he
was tapping joints instead of soldering them.
Says he only hired him on account of the shortage
of electricians and helpers ... because of the last Army draft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get his address?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got it, Chief.... It is over on Fifty-third
Street near the River.... I didn&#8217;t go.... I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>wanted to see you first.... There&#8217;s more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The superintendent says he never sent
that trouble-hunter over here last night.... There&#8217;s a record of sending another man named
Frisby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see&mdash;Frisby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; Drew&#8217;s fingers had
clutched the operative&#8217;s arm. &#8220;What did he
say?&#8221; he repeated grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Said, that Albert&mdash;that&#8217;s the trouble-hunter&mdash;had stopped
him on the way over here and
took his place.... Said, he was satisfied.... Albert could have <i>all</i> the jobs on a night like
last night. That&#8217;s just what Frisby said,
Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew loosened his fingers from Delaney&#8217;s
arm and turned slowly. The portières swayed
slightly. They shook anew. They parted at
the center and revealed Loris Stockbridge. Her
eyes burned the soft gloom with glazed interrogation.
She raised her white hand and pressed
back her hair from her forehead. She stepped
forward with her knees striking against the
stiff satin of her skirt. She swung from Delaney
toward Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you saying?&#8221; she asked imperiously.
&#8220;What did you say about a trouble-man?
What was it, please?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; for one, Miss!&#8221; declared Delaney.
&#8220;I was over at the telephone company&#8217;s
exchange lookin&#8217; for the lad that was here last
night and fixed the junction-box in the yard back
of the house. Mr. Drew wants him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris turned toward the detective. &#8220;You
want him?&#8221; she asked softly. &#8220;What do you
want him for? Please tell me. I don&#8217;t like him,
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Drew&#8217;s turn to draw in his breath.
He eyed the girl. He tried to fathom the reason
for her simple question and her objection.
&#8220;Miss Loris,&#8221; he said, shrugging his square
shoulders. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a slight matter. The
man has disappeared. We can&#8217;t find him. He&#8217;s
flown&mdash;perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a little chap with a satchel and a
testing set?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;A nice-mannered,
soft-voiced little man who was so obliging, and
yet so&mdash;oh! I don&#8217;t know what I have against
him. He&#8217;s so sly&mdash;don&#8217;t you think so, Mr.
Dr&mdash;e&mdash;w?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you ever see him?&#8221; asked Drew,
feeling the blood rising to his cheeks at a
thought which surged through his brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet him? Why! he was here early this afternoon.
He was all over the house!&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;SUSPICION FASTENS&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Triggy Drew had been trained in the
hardest school in the world. Loris
Stockbridge&#8217;s statement, delivered with
such sincerity and so naïvely, completely upset
him. It was like a gentle reminder that, as a
hunter of men, he had failed. He took the blow
with flaming cheeks and an almost stopped
heart.</p>

<p>Delaney realized that something of moment
in the case had happened. He stared at his
chief, then turned his eyes upon Harry Nichols,
who stepped through the portières and stood by
Loris&#8217; side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Chief?&#8221; asked the operative.
&#8220;Was there anything in what she said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything!&#8221; exclaimed Drew, recovering
himself with a tossing shrug of his shoulders.
&#8220;Anything? Everything! The man we want
is<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found?&#8221; breathed Loris clutching Nichols&#8217;
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet&mdash;but <i>very</i> soon!&#8221; said the detective
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>with sanguine eyes. &#8220;We want that trouble-hunter,
Delaney,&#8221; he added gathering in the
details for action as he spoke. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to
hurry right over to the address and see if you
can round him up. If he isn&#8217;t there&mdash;get him!
I want him brought here at once. He&#8217;s got
much to explain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go right now,&#8221; said Delaney, starting
toward the reception room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Drew.</p>

<p>Delaney turned at the portières.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t phone me here,&#8221; the detective
warned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything by telephone.
We&#8217;re on the trail of a man or men who can tap
wires. He or they may have a confederate in
this house. Be careful&mdash;get your suspect and
bring him here. We&#8217;ll try him with the footprints.
We&#8217;ll check up with the fingerprints.
Then, if he don&#8217;t cave in, we&#8217;ll turn him over
to Fosdick and the Third Degree. I firmly believe
that Albert, whom I saw in the library
and who was in this house in the early afternoon
of this day, is implicated in the murder.
Strange that I never suspected him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going!&#8221; growled Delaney, tearing his
eyes away from Loris and glancing through the
curtains. &#8220;I&#8217;m right after him, Chief. I won&#8217;t
stop till I get him, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t make it in thirty minutes,&#8221; said
Drew glancing sharply at his watch, &#8220;if you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>don&#8217;t make it by then&mdash;come back here. Perhaps
something will have turned up in the meantime.
Get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief! Good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney had passed through the portières,
crossed the reception room and pressed aside
the tapestries leading to the hallways, before
Drew stepped to the broad doorway and motioned
for Loris and Nichols to take their former
positions. He waited until they were seated
with their faces in the shadow cast by the
overhead silken hangings. He spoke then, and
to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;This case,&#8221; he said, thrusting his hands in
his coat pockets and striding back and forth.
&#8220;This case is clearing clue by clue. The trouble-man,
whom some one let into the house this
afternoon, is the missing link in the chain of
circumstance and applied deduction. Who let
him in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew stopped in his stride. &#8220;You, Nichols?&#8221;
he questioned sharply. &#8220;Why did you let him
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I asked Harry to,&#8221; defended Loris
with heat. &#8220;I heard the bell ring. I sent the
maid downstairs. She came back and told me
that a man from the telephone company was
waiting to look over the connections. She said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>that he said that there was trouble with the
wires.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; exclaimed Drew; &#8220;that
is,&#8221; he added hastily, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there
was anything the matter at all. In the light of
what Delaney has told me, that fellow came
here last night, when some one else named Frosby
or Frisby was sent. Now why would he
want to take another&#8217;s place? For one reason
only&mdash;the same reason that he came here this
afternoon. This reason concerns your future
health and security. We had one death in this
house which followed his first visit. We don&#8217;t
want anything to happen after his second visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Mr. Drew,&#8221; said Nichols.
&#8220;I was careless. I went down stairs and talked
with the fellow. It was just a few minutes
after I arrived from downtown. He seemed so
plausible that I asked the Central Office Detective
at the door, who gave the permission. It
was all my fault, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did this fellow go? What did he do
in the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went into the library and tested the
phone there. The connection seemed to be all
right. Then he went down stairs and tested
the butler&#8217;s &#8217;phone. The butler had been taken
as a material witness by Fosdick. I followed
the man. He didn&#8217;t do anything but test and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>then talk with Franklin Official&mdash;I think it
was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he talked over the phone?
It&#8217;s ridiculously easy for a person to hold down
the hook and make believe they are talking to
most anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that, Mr. Drew,&#8221; said
the captain, turning toward Loris. &#8220;Did he
talk to anybody when he used this &#8217;phone, Miss
Stockbridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so, Harry. I really thought he
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew furrowed his brows in perplexity. There
was no evidence shown that the trouble-man
had ever talked with anybody, via wire, from
the mansion. He recalled the first appearance
of the lineman in the library. That time both
calls, to Central, might have been feigned by
holding down the hook and speaking into a disconnected
transmitter. The man was clever.
He knew all there was to be known concerning
telephony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a child,&#8221; the detective concluded, swinging
about the room in perplexity. &#8220;One thing,&#8221;
he added aloud to Loris and Nichols. &#8220;One
thing! We are absolutely alone in this part of
the house. I have locked the maid in her room.
No one can get through the door to the hall.
There&#8217;s a spring lock on it. Delaney closed it
when he went out.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;And there&#8217;s a score of detectives scattered
about,&#8221; said the captain reassuringly, as he
leaned toward Loris. &#8220;Why should we fear
anything at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, Harry,&#8221; said Loris, &#8220;if it wasn&#8217;t
for what happened to poor father. Mr. Drew
took the same precautions and had everything
locked and watched. It doesn&#8217;t seem as if we
were in New York at all. It seems like some
mediæval time and place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew reached for a fragile-looking chair,
turned it, sat down and thrust his custom-made
shoes out across the rug in the direction of
Loris and Nichols, whose faces shone white
and drawn in the soft light of the alcove where
they were seated.</p>

<p>Swirling thought surged through the detective&#8217;s
brain. He went over the case with dulled
understanding. Briefly, he had eliminated the
former suspects and compressed the matter into
a small compass. His conclusion brought him
to his feet with slow swaying from side to side.
Some one in state prison was probably directing
matters. Some one in New York was carrying
out the arch-fiend&#8217;s orders. This free agent had
the nerve of the damned and the cunning of
Cagliostro. He had succeeded in planting a confederate
in the mansion, or entering himself,
and slaying Stockbridge. The entire case, concluded
Drew, rested in capturing the free agent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>before he could do further murder. Loris was
marked and had been from the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;What servants remain?&#8221; he asked, dropping
his hand on his right hip pocket and feeling the
bulge of an automatic there. &#8220;Which of the
servants, Miss Stockbridge, have Fosdick and
his men left for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The French maid,&#8221; said Loris softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her! She looks all right. She says
she has been with you five or six years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six&mdash;almost. It&#8217;s been over six years, Mr.
Drew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That ought to let her out of the case. Now,
the next one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The housekeeper, Mrs. Seeley. She has been
with us ten or twelve years&mdash;ever since I can
remember. Mother thought the world of Mrs.
Seeley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s valet. They didn&#8217;t arrest him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was down to my office. He looks all
right. I&#8217;ll cross him off the list of suspects.
Now, are there any more servants in the
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a French chef and a pantry man, I
think. Also there&#8217;s a poor old darkey who tends
to the furnace. I don&#8217;t believe he leaves the
basement. I never see him, only on holidays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The butler, then, and the doorman and the
second man and the rest of the servants have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>been taken down to Center Street for interrogation
and as suspects. That leaves us with very
few to handle, Miss Stockbridge. I&#8217;m going to
start by securing the door which leads into the
hallway. Then we&#8217;ll wait here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew hurried through the tapestries, stopped,
and examined the lock of the door before he shot
home a second bolt which was functioned by a
butterfly of heavy gold alloy. He stood erect
with both hands pressing at his temples. It
came to him with double force that the same
precautions had been taken when Stockbridge
was alone in the library downstairs. There was
the lock of superior make and the winged-latch.
There was the two-inch, or more, door of dark
wood. There were the servants and detectives
both within and outside the mansion. Yet the
millionaire had been reached in a secret manner
through all the precautions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things repeat, sometimes,&#8221; mused Drew,
fingering the catch and the flat key. &#8220;The same
conditions bring the same results. I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective&#8217;s voice trailed into a whisper as
he heard footsteps outside the door. He reached
back to his pocket and waited. His heart
thumped like a prisoned bird within his breast.
It was a case of strained nerves. He felt the
responsibility of guarding Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; he exclaimed, recovering himself and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>squaring his jaw. &#8220;Bah,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;It&#8217;s
somebody for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door after twisting the butterfly
and turning the flat key in the lock. A blurred
figure pressed forward. A gruff voice boomed
from a muffling collar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Chief! I&#8217;m back in a half-hour! No
luck, either!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited until Delaney had removed his
overcoat and overshoes, which he placed in one
corner by a hall-tree. &#8220;What did you find?&#8221;
he asked glancing toward the tapestries.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow&#8217;s beat it for good. Landlady
says he owes her one week&#8217;s rent. He cleaned
out with a suit-case and left this.&#8221; The operative
reached in his pocket and brought forth a
single drill of quarter-inch diameter. He held
it out. &#8220;All I could find, Chief, after a quick
frisk. This was in the mattress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Regulation lineman&#8217;s wood-bit,&#8221; said Drew
as he examined the size number on the shank.
&#8220;This might have been the one used in boring
the hole between the slot-booths at Grand Central
Station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Albert is the lad, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know, yet. There&#8217;s lots of bits
like this one. Did you try it for fingerprints?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all rubbed off! I had to pull it
from the mattress. It was stuck in a hole near
the foot of the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>&#8220;Hold it!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Hold it for evidence.
Put it with your plaster casts.
Now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at his watch. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out
to that drug-store,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to phone.
I can&#8217;t use the phones of this house. The
wires may be tapped. You stay right by this
door and wait till I get back. It won&#8217;t be more
than ten minutes. Go get my hat when you&#8217;re
putting the bit away. It&#8217;s in the corner by Loris
and Nichols. Tell them I&#8217;m stepping out and
that you will stand guard. They might hold
me. She is very nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney was back at the detective&#8217;s side, after
a clumsy stride through the tapestries. &#8220;Cute
couple,&#8221; he said, jerking his thumb over-shoulder
toward the inner room. &#8220;They&#8217;re sittin&#8217;
there so close you couldn&#8217;t get a sheet of paper
between them. I like that colleen, Chief! She&#8217;s
the kind you see on them magazine covers&mdash;only
prettier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cat can look at a queen,&#8221; quoted Drew,
pulling down his hat and opening the door wide.
&#8220;Be sure and lock this after me,&#8221; he warned.
&#8220;Lock and bolt it. Stand guard and don&#8217;t let
anybody in at all. I&#8217;m only going round the
block.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney shut the door and turned the key.
He followed this action by twisting the butterfly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>Then he drew his gun and waited, grimly
alert.</p>

<p>Drew reached the drug-store after a brisk,
lung-cleansing walk through the down-driving
snow. He dropped a coin in the slot and first
called up his office. Harrigan, who had remained
at his post, answered for most of the
operatives who were out on the case and who
had &#8217;phoned in at every opportunity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Frick at the prison,&#8221; Drew shot back,
after making a few notes. &#8220;Get him and tell
him to call up this &#8217;phone,&#8221; Drew glanced at
the number over the transmitter. &#8220;Tell him
to call up Gramercy Hill 9749 and let whoever
I station here, know to whom and to what number
Morphy is talking in New York. Get
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; came back over the wires. &#8220;Sure,
Chief. You want to pinch the fellow he&#8217;s connecting
with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;We can work
it this way. As soon as I find out from Frick
where Morphy or anybody else is &#8217;phoning from
the prison, I can get a man over there in time
to make the arrest. The superintendent at
Gramercy Hill will help us out if the call comes
through his exchange. He can get the girl to
stall for a minute or two. I&#8217;ll send Delaney
here to hold this end of the wire. You keep
him posted as to developments. O&#8217;Toole, yes!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>He&#8217;s planted in the alley back of the house. He
can&#8217;t report. All the others are all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew hung up with a flip of the receiver. He
backed out of the booth and hurried around the
corner. He reached the iron-grilled gate of the
mansion with his head down and the snow seeping
between his collar and his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rotten night!&#8221; said the Central Office man
at the door. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll hear anything
from anybody. Them gunmen like the backrooms
of saloons too well to pull off a gun-play
in this storm, Inspector.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; said Drew, shaking
his coat and hurrying toward the stairway
which led to Loris Stockbridge&#8217;s apartment.</p>

<p>Delaney opened the door after a repeated
knock in Morse code. He eyed his chief. He
motioned toward the inner rooms. &#8220;All quiet,&#8221;
he said with a broad smile. &#8220;Them turtle doves
sure like to be left alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you would too! Especially if you lost
your only relative the night before&mdash;lost him
in the way she lost hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big operative gulped down the thrust.
&#8220;What did you find out?&#8221; he asked in a husky
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your coat on. Get over to that drug-store
and plant near that booth&mdash;Gramercy Hill
9749. Frick, at the prison, is going to call that
booth up as soon as Morphy or anybody else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>there tries to get New York. If Frick gives
you a number, call up the superintendent at
Gramercy Hill and tell him who you are. He&#8217;s
on duty all night. He&#8217;ll give you the address
of the number, and stall the call. That&#8217;ll give
you time to rush to the address and grab your
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll grab him, Chief!&#8221; rumbled Delaney,
reaching for his storm coat which was supposed
to be fur-lined. &#8220;Leave that to me!&#8221; he
added. &#8220;Jus&#8217; leave it tu me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew eyed the operative&#8217;s huge hands. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
do that,&#8221; he said with a short laugh. &#8220;Now
hurry! No, wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Chief?&#8221; asked Delaney in the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the address is downtown, or in Brooklyn,
what would you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d get the office, Chief, and have Harrigan
rush over a man. This super at Gramercy Hill
ought to be able to stall that call long enough
for us to connect&mdash;with both hands and both
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it!&#8221; said Drew, pressing Delaney out
through the door. &#8220;Good luck,&#8221; he added as he
twisted the key and shot the bolt. &#8220;Now we
are getting there,&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;Unfortunately
for that devil up-the-river, he has to
phone from <i>one</i> place. That&#8217;s the thing which
will beat him. I hate to think what would happen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>if he was outside giving orders. He could
get away with it, nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew never felt surer of himself in a case.
He tested the lock and bolt for a second time.
He draped the tapestries and strode into the
sitting room with his shoulders held back&mdash;a
sanguine light in his olive eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Miss Stockbridge,&#8221; he said, pausing
in the center of the room and smiling. &#8220;I think
we are on the verge of big things. The attempt
cannot be made to-night without we have plenty
of warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Loris, standing upright
and arranging her lavender gown about her
slipper-tops. &#8220;That&#8217;s the best news I&#8217;ve heard
in a long time, Mr. Drew,&#8221; she added, glancing
archly at the detective, beneath her dark lashes.
&#8220;Has that Mr. Delaney found any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew raised his brows. Loris&#8217; question was
not exactly a compliment to the big operative,
who meant so well.</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t found anything,&#8221; said Drew, with
soft, pleasing voice. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t done that,
but I&#8217;m venturing my future reputation that he
will find our man&mdash;the trouble-man perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols stepped to Loris&#8217; side. &#8220;We
were children there,&#8221; he admitted frankly. &#8220;At
least I was. I never suspected him at all. His
manners were so pleasant. He seemed so weak
and intent about his business.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Drew, raising his finger. &#8220;That&#8217;s
it! He was intent about <i>his</i> business. Only,
this particular business concerned the taking of
a human life in cold blood. Mr. Stockbridge
was murdered by this fiend, in the guise of a
harmless trouble-hunter. How the murder was
accomplished and by what lethal method we do
not know. I&#8217;m acting on the theory that if we
catch the man we will find out how it was done.
If I can&#8217;t make him&mdash;Fosdick, Commissioner of
Detectives, will. May God help him if he doesn&#8217;t
talk to Fosdick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t we find out how father was
killed?&#8221; asked Loris, with tears glazing over
her eyes. &#8220;It don&#8217;t seem&mdash;it don&#8217;t<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain caught Loris about the waist and
led her to the divan in the alcove. She sank
down with her face covered with her hands. Soft
sobs, brought to her throat by the memory of
the murder, caused Drew to pace the rugs with
alert, nervous strides like a man who would
guard her from some menacing shadow. He
went to the ventilators and closed them slightly.
He crossed the room to the radiator-boxes and
set them in an open position. He adjusted a
thermostat on the wall, to seventy degrees. He
stood back then and listened with both ears
strained for outside sounds.</p>

<p>Snow sifted across the curtain-drawn panes
with a cutting of fine diamonds against diamonds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>A wind whistled and moaned and swirled
over the turrets and towers of the mansion.
An echo lifted from the driving traffic of the
Avenue. Below this echo, so faint it seemed
like a murmur of a distant sea, the city throbbed
with the shifting of the whimpering wind. Once
it roared. Then afterward there was silence,
save for the sifting snow, and Loris&#8217; low, throat
choke from welling sorrow.</p>

<p>She sat up finally and dried her eyes. &#8220;I
should be ashamed of myself,&#8221; she said, brokenly.
&#8220;I must be brave. I fear something,
though. It seems to be in the room or the air.
What is it I fear, Mr. Drew?&#8221; Her question
was vague. Her eyes shone hectically bright
and strangely alluring to the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to fear!&#8221; he declared with
a direct glance. &#8220;I&#8217;m armed! Then,&#8221; he added
as an additional encouragement. &#8220;Then,
Mr. Nichols is a soldier! You are in safe hands,
believe me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harry Nichols bowed politely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a
gun, myself,&#8221; he admitted candidly. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
that little one, either. It&#8217;s army regulation.
It, or the ones like it, have been stopping the
Huns. I guess we&#8217;ll take care of anything that
comes up to-night, Mr. Drew. It&#8217;s getting late,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective glanced at his watch. &#8220;I ought
to hear from Delaney,&#8221; he said, replacing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>watch and reaching for a chair. &#8220;Delaney is
like old Dobbin&mdash;faithful and slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew sat down, pulled at the knees of his
black trousers and rested his heels on the thick
soft pile of a Persian rug. Behind him was
the cheval glass and the telephone stand. Before
him, and in the shade of the silk draperies,
Loris&#8217; eyes glowed alongside the captain&#8217;s resolute
face.</p>

<p>The minutes passed with the trio in the same
position. The snow sifted across the cold panes.
The wind whined. Suddenly between gusts, Loris
asked point-blankly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suspect that man, Morphy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I do!&#8221; said Drew with a snap. &#8220;I believe
that every single lead we have points to
him. I believe he planned to destroy your father
ever since the day of conviction. I believe<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is in prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the detective, with bright eyes.
&#8220;So is his master, Lucifer, in the lower regions.
He&#8217;s there, but he has a long arm. Morphy&#8217;s
tool in this affair is probably the telephone repair-man.
You saw him. Mr. Nichols saw him.
I saw him. We all agree that he does not look
the part of a scoundrel and a scoundrel&#8217;s tool.
But,&#8221; Drew paused and spread out his hands;
&#8220;but,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that&#8217;s the reason he was
chosen for Morphy&#8217;s murderous work. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>can&#8217;t send a thug into a drawing room&mdash;or a
library. You can&#8217;t cut a sharp slice with a dull
tool. This trouble-hunter is all that the name
implies&mdash;a hunter of trouble. I don&#8217;t doubt
that we have the case rounded up, save for
bringing him in. Morphy, we can get at any
time. He&#8217;s in prison and he&#8217;s getting very
close to the little green door that leads to the
electric-chair. One slip to-night, and we have
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stockbridge must go south after the
funeral,&#8221; said Nichols. &#8220;She can&#8217;t be jeopardized!
She is nervous and has suffered acutely.
I for one am sorry we let her stay here. It is
the place she should not be. They know where
to look for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re beat to-night,&#8221; assured Drew, rising
and stretching his arms. &#8220;My! my!&#8221; he
added, &#8220;this is slow, sleepy work. I&#8217;d ask for
tea, but I think it&#8217;s best we stay locked in here.
Don&#8217;t you, Miss Stockbridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marie can get some. There&#8217;s a service-waiter
running up to her room. Suppose I order
tea, or coffee, and cakes. It might cheer us
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew held out a warding arm as Loris rose
and started toward the writing room. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tend to it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You stay right here close
up to Mr. Nichols. We&#8217;re taking no chances at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>The detective parted the portières and
knocked upon the maid&#8217;s door as he turned the
key with his left hand. He waited as she gave
the order through a silver-plated speaking tube.
He heard the service-waiter rising. He leaned
forward and took the tray with a sharp glance
about the maid&#8217;s room. It was as clean and
as neat as a work basket. A French novel, with
a vivid portrait of a poilu carrying a very sharp
bayonet on its cover, lay in the center of a white
counterpane on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221; he said as he closed and carefully
locked the door. He reached downward
and caught up the tray. He started across the
writing-room. He paused in its center as he
heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;Burrrr! Burrrr! Burrrrr!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shrillingly the perfumed air of the suite vibrated
with the silver notes of the telephone.
Drew hesitated, with the tray balanced in his
hand. He took one step forward as Loris
swished across the sitting-room, lifted the hard-rubber
receiver and voiced a soft, &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew let go of the tray and sprang forward.
He parted the portières and watched Loris&#8217;
face. It changed between seconds to a flushed
mask of crimson-fear. She staggered back,
dropped the receiver, and cried &#8220;Harry!&#8221; as
she sank to the floor.</p>

<p>Drew darted across the rugs and snatched up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>the instrument. He heard a low, chuckling
laugh that died to a whisper and then to nothingness.
He flipped the receiver back on the
hook. He turned with a savage twist. He
stared across the room toward Loris, who had
risen to her knees and whose head was against
Nichols&#8217; olive-drab breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was said?&#8221; he questioned sharply.</p>

<p>A mass of turbaned, midnight-hued hair uncoiled
and fell about the girl&#8217;s white face. Glorious
eyes dulled, then glowed, with the fire
which was pulsing within her. Her lips trembled
and went blanched as she throated brokenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The man&mdash;the man at the other end said.... He said that his master had ordered my
coffin.... He said that I had only a few hours
to live.... He said that he would call me up
again.... For me to be ready then, to meet
my Master and my&mdash;doom.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;A SILENT PRISONER&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Loris Stockbridge finished speaking
with a low sob which went straight to the
detective&#8217;s heart. He advanced across
the room and ran his arm about her supple
waist. &#8220;We&#8217;ll help her to the divan,&#8221; he told
Nichols. &#8220;That&#8217;s it! Right over here and in
the corner. She&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ll tend to that
threat which came over the wires.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew backed away and turned toward the
telephone. He eyed it with cold calculation.
He took one step further, then wheeled and
glanced at Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to trace that call if it is humanly
possible,&#8221; he said with decision. &#8220;We can find
out, at least, from where it came. Suppose you
leave me here with Miss Stockbridge, and you
go down stairs and around to the drug-store?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris rested her weight on one elbow. She
sat erect, with slowly widening eyes. Her hands
strayed to her hair and pressed it back from
her ears. She gained command of herself after
a shudder had passed through her slender body.
She half rose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that voice before!&#8221; she exclaimed,
pointing toward the &#8217;phone. &#8220;It was
familiar, Mr. Drew. Now where have I heard
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some friend of your father&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it was. But I&#8217;ve heard it
in this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A servant&mdash;the valet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! No, Mr. Drew, it wasn&#8217;t the valet&#8217;s
voice. It was whispering and consumptive. It
squeaked. It sounded like a little boy&#8217;s voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about that trouble-man?&#8221; Drew advanced
with keen steps. He felt that he was
very close to the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been. Only&mdash;only, Mr. Drew,
it was younger&mdash;thinner&mdash;squeakier. It was a
terrible voice. It rings and rings in my ears.
It was so sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ump!&#8221; declared Drew with clenched fists.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be so sure,&#8221; he said, squaring his
jaw. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be near so sure, next time. I
think it was that trouble-man you heard. Don&#8217;t
you remember anything he said when he was in
the house, for comparison?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just heard him say&mdash;I heard him say that
the connections, I think he called them, were all
right. Then he went away, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did his voice squeak then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was rather low&mdash;like a boy&#8217;s or a girl&#8217;s.
He seemed too polite. He had his cap in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>hand.&#8221; Loris stopped speaking and stood erect.
She arranged her gown and glanced down at
Nichols. &#8220;I feel stronger,&#8221; she said bravely.
&#8220;I wonder what became of that tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew stepped into the writing-room and
found the tea-pot upon its side. He poured
from this a cup of tea which he carried to Nichols.
&#8220;Just taste it,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;I want to
be sure it isn&#8217;t doped or anything like that.
That&#8217;s it. Just a small swallow. It&#8217;s all right,
isn&#8217;t it? It isn&#8217;t bitter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols handed the cup to Loris. &#8220;Drink it,&#8221;
he said with confidence. &#8220;That&#8217;s good tea&mdash;only
a little cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew took the empty cup and set it down on
a small table. &#8220;You&#8217;ll go for me?&#8221; he asked
Nichols. &#8220;I want it traced without using the
wires of this house. They might be tapped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be back in ten minutes!&#8221; said the captain
at the tapestries, after Loris had nodded.
&#8220;Whom shall I ask for at Gramercy Hill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The superintendent&mdash;Jack Nefe! If he isn&#8217;t
there, get the chief operator. Delaney will attend
to that. Find out from what number the
call came. We might get that whispering devil
right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it was the trouble-man,&#8221; said Loris,
as Drew returned after locking the door to
the hallway. &#8220;Now that I think of it&mdash;I&#8217;m almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>sure it was. He just tried to change and
lower his voice&mdash;that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lower it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Drew. It was so faint that I hardly
heard it at first. He seemed afraid of something.
Perhaps somebody was in the room
where he was telephoning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might have been. Well&mdash;he can&#8217;t hurt
or harm you that way. The thing is for you to
keep up your courage. Fear is a terrible thing
if you would let yourself be mastered by it. It
might be their game to break you down by a
series of threats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do that. I&#8217;ve Harry and you to
stand by me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew pulled out his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting toward
midnight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No word yet from
Delaney or any of the others on watch. I think
that the storm will clear soon. You can go to
bed. Harry&mdash;Mr. Nichols and I&#8217;ll get a deck
of cards and keep watch out here. We&#8217;ll do
sentry duty. He&#8217;s used to that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris glided about the room. She stopped at
the cheval glass and arranged her hair with a
series of twists that formed a turban secured
by loops. She swished around and glanced
archly toward Drew. Their eyes met bravely.
Hers dropped under shading lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she whispered with a half
laugh. &#8220;I did look awful. It was the shock of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>hearing that terrible man. How childish to call
me up and say what he did. He didn&#8217;t mean
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Drew, reaching in his pocket and
bringing out a key. &#8220;Ah, he did mean it, I
think. He has overreached himself by telephoning.
Gramercy Hill Exchange is on the alert.
There&#8217;s Mr. Nichols with good news, at the
door. Now for his report.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain came in, brushing snow from his
olive-drab uniform. He glanced at Loris as
he strode across the room and took her hand
with a firm grip. &#8220;Delaney,&#8221; he said confidentially,
&#8220;was right at the booth. He was sitting
on a chair, propped up and talking with
the prescription clerk. He did the telephoning
to Gramercy Hill. I don&#8217;t know who he got
there, but they already knew about the call.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols turned toward Drew for confirmation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; the detective exclaimed.
&#8220;They should know! The vice-president, Westlake,
has left orders to record all calls to this
house. Where was that whispering voice from,
Mr. Nichols?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Forty-second Street and Broadway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Close!&#8221; exclaimed Drew, rubbing his hands.
&#8220;The fellow took chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came from a slot-booth in a cigar store in
a big building. It only lasted two minutes. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>operator at Gramercy Hill says the first voice
she heard, asking for Gramercy Hill 9764, was
harsh and loud. I don&#8217;t understand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Harsh and loud,&#8221; repeated Drew, toying
with his watch chain. &#8220;That&#8217;s odd. Was it
the same man that Miss Stockbridge heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The operator don&#8217;t know. Delaney says
maybe there were two of them. One, who called
up, and one who talked to this room.&#8221; Nichols
turned and nodded toward the silver-plated
telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly possible,&#8221; mused Drew. &#8220;I think he
changed his voice after he got the connection.
He didn&#8217;t want Miss Stockbridge to recognize
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris glanced at the two men. &#8220;What will
they do?&#8221; she asked anxiously. &#8220;Will Mr.
Delaney and the other detectives catch him by
that call?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;He was in and out
within three minutes. The bird has flown from
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where will he go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Miss Stockbridge. I wish that
I did know. There are over a hundred thousand
telephones in New York he could use. It&#8217;s
impossible to guess which one. The booths at
the Grand Central are covered by one of my
operatives. The telephone company is on the
alert for all calls to this house. All they can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>do is to record them and tell us what happens
after it happens. We are trying now to get this
whispering dog when he is compelled to wait
at a booth. If Morphy &#8217;phones him from the
prison to-night we have him. The telephone
company is going to delay the call after getting
the number. It would look natural. Then, we
can strike at the booth or place where the call
is directed in time to catch the man Morphy is
telephoning to. Up to now, Morphy has not
&#8217;phoned or Delaney would have said something
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you stop these calls?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very easy. We could order the wires disconnected.
But then we wouldn&#8217;t catch our
man. He would be suspicious and wait for another
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole thing seems so strange, Mr. Drew.
We&#8217;re locked in here. The house is so well
guarded. All they can do is &#8217;phone and yet we&mdash;at least I am
nervous. Why have I got that
strange feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From experience!&#8221; declared Drew. &#8220;If we
knew how your poor father was killed there
wouldn&#8217;t be cause for worry. We don&#8217;t know.
It was so subtle that we are confronted with the
unknown in terrible form. You feel a shadow
and so do I. A reaching shadow about this
splendid house of yours. It isn&#8217;t anything we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>can grasp and say, &#8216;Come here! You&#8217;re under
arrest.&#8217; It&#8217;s the uncanny mystery of the entire
case that holds us three on the ragged-edge. I
confess I have not been myself since last night.
The powers of darkness and Lucifer, himself,
have nothing on the people we are fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about running Morphy in the guard
house, or whatever they have up there?&#8221; asked
Nichols. &#8220;Why not lay the case before the
warden and have him put out of harm&#8217;s way?
That&#8217;s what they&#8217;d do in the Army!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t prove a single thing on him!&#8221;
declared Drew. &#8220;He used the &#8217;phone&mdash;once or
twice. Perhaps he has permission from the
superintendent of state prisons to do so. He
has business interests which require his telephoning,
we&#8217;ll say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re just going to wait right here?&#8221;
asked Loris, stamping her slipper. &#8220;Wait right
here and let them do their worst?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The city detectives would do the same thing
I&#8217;m doing,&#8221; said Drew on the defensive.
&#8220;They&#8217;d trap their men. Do you want to see
the man or men who slayed your father, escape?
He will, or they will, unless we give them enough
rope to hang themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or wire!&#8221; said Nichols cheerfully. &#8220;No,
Loris, Mr. Drew is right. He&#8217;s done everything.
All we have got to do, is wait. Let&#8217;s sit down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>for a little while. Delaney said he might have
word soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew waited until Loris had pressed herself
into a small compass at the back of the divan,
with Harry Nichols leaning over her in a shielding
position which was thoughtful and at the
same time affectionate. He strode toward the
writing room and parted the heavy, silk portières.
He studied every detail. He dropped
the portières and crossed the sitting room to
the doorway leading into Loris&#8217; chamber. This,
too, he searched with his eyes. Backing to the
center of the room he dropped his chin in
thought. A sound outside the mansion caused
him to turn and hurry to a window. He brushed
the curtain aside and tried to peer out. He
rubbed the frosted glass vigorously. His nose
pressed to a white button as he searched the
side street. A taxi had come to a grinding halt
directly below the window. Its wheels spun
upon the slippery surface. A man leaned out
of an open doorway and urged the driver on
with a brandished fist of ham-like proportions.
The driver backed into the snow, dropped into
first speed and stepped on his throttle. The
taxi leaped forward, gripped the surface, and
plowed toward Fifth Avenue in a welter of
flying ice and flakes.</p>

<p>Drew sprang back and faced Loris and Nichols
who had risen and were standing together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>in the glow from the cluster over their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; they asked in unison.
&#8220;What was outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney!&#8221; snapped Drew, dragging out his
watch and glancing at it. &#8220;Delaney&#8217;s got word
where to find his man. He&#8217;s on the trail at
last! It&#8217;s twelve-two. We ought to have that
fellow in a half hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble-man?&#8221; asked Loris, with rising
hopes. &#8220;Do you think it is the trouble-man, Mr.
Drew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine chances in ten, it is! I&#8217;m venturing a
guess it is. If we get him&mdash;if Delaney gets
him&mdash;he&#8217;ll know it. Delaney used to work under
the old-time police chiefs. They showed
scant consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, he won&#8217;t hurt him!&#8221; said Loris, with
a tremulous exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That murderer! Why, Miss Stockbridge,
isn&#8217;t he plotting to slay you? Didn&#8217;t he kill
your father? I wish I were in Delaney&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me too!&#8221; declared Nichols, drawing closer
to the detective. &#8220;Say, Inspector, I want to
congratulate you. I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Harry. Just wait! You two sit down
and be quiet. This affair is a personal one with
me. I don&#8217;t doubt that Morphy or perhaps
some one else in state prison &#8217;phoned to the
same party who phoned Miss Loris. That was
all we needed. Delaney jumped into a taxi
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>and hurried downtown as fast as the storm permitted.
Perhaps the call came from the same
booth. I don&#8217;t think so, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one at Forty-second Street and Broadway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, Nichols. This fellow seems
to pick a new one every time. He&#8217;s very crafty.
That alone shows a criminal mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew paced the floor with soft gliding. He
turned at the portières and crossed to the tapestries.
He returned and stood before Loris and
Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we can now begin to
reconstruct this case. We can get some of the
dead-wood from our minds. It is apparent to
me that one of Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s sworn enemies&mdash;Morphy, for instance&mdash;confined
in state&#8217;s
prison, set about to slay both members of the
family. He secured a confederate whom he
knew. This confederate has never been arrested
in the state. We have that from the finger
prints in the booth at Grand Central. We will
presume that this confederate is the trouble-man.
He is probably an expert electrician. He
either tapped in on the wires the night Mr.
Stockbridge was murdered or got behind the
switchboard and called up the library &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The switchboard?&#8221; asked Loris. &#8220;You
mean the big place where the girls are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly there. The wires run down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>are tagged. It would be possible for him to cut
in somewhere between the switchboard and the
conduits. Now I don&#8217;t know how it was done.
There&#8217;s several ways. But wherever he tapped
in, he must have used a magneto to ring Mr.
Stockbridge up, and afterwards a battery-set to
do the talking. All this Westlake says it would
be necessary to do, so that the operator would
not notice a permanent signal on the board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his object?&#8221; asked Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;To cover himself. He first disconnected the
wires and waited till I sent for a trouble-man.
Frosby, or Frisby, was sent. The trouble-man
took his place. He came here and looked the
place over. He lied to Mr. Stockbridge and I
when he told us about that tall German in the
alley. If there was such a man there before
the snow froze we would have his footprints.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t them?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Delaney has a set made by this trouble-hunter
when he was at the junction-box. This
must have been the time he either cut the connections
so that I would send for him, or it was
the time when he called up and threatened Mr.
Stockbridge with death within twelve hours.
You remember that the telephone company have
no record of the call. Now the next call<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there another?&#8221; the girl asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;to your father at or about the moment
he died. That was from the Grand Central Station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>at Forty-second Street. There&#8217;s a good
record of that. Your father knocked the telephone
down when he dropped dead. The operator
noticed that the connection was open and
put on the howler. The record is clear on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is all this twisting and turning
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To throw us off, Miss Stockbridge. We&#8217;re
dealing with a crafty, cunning mind. This mind
took the extreme precaution of connecting two
booths at Grand Central so that a man in Sing
Sing could talk to your father without leaving a
record at the Westchester Exchange or at Gramercy
Hill Exchange. How this was done I don&#8217;t
know. It could be done with auxiliary batteries
and looping so that the Gramercy Hill operator
thought the Westchester call was to a slot booth,
while another call from the next booth to this
house was really the same connection shunted
or looped through. Westlake, vice-president of
the telephone company, says that there would
be several ways of doing this. He added it
would take an expert in telephony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all twisted up, Mr. Drew. I suppose
you understand it. But what about that call
to-night&mdash;the one that frightened me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man was sure of himself!&#8221; said Drew
without thinking. &#8220;He has his plans made. He
figures they will not fail!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>&#8220;I mean, Miss Stockbridge, that he expects to
slay you in the same manner your father was
slain. We have this advantage. You are not
alone in this room or these rooms. Your father
was alone. The murderer will have Mr. Nichols
and myself to deal with this time! Be calm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I don&#8217;t see how he could&mdash;get in
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor do I. The point is that he got into the
library and out again without trace. He had an
hour to do his work in. Here, he is running
every risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has already been here, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective glanced keenly at Nichols, who
had shot the statement straight through clean
white teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; Drew said with a trace of anxiety
in his voice. &#8220;That is disquieting. But
we have searched these rooms and found absolutely
no trace of tampering with locks or ventilators
or window-catches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could he climb up here? He might have
climbing irons,&#8221; added Nichols glancing toward
the windows.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good porch-climber could do it,&#8221; Drew
mused, with his eyes sweeping the curtains.
&#8220;A very good one could. There are only three
or four good ones out of prisons. They never
go in for murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t money buy them?&#8221; asked Loris.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>&#8220;Mr. Morphy may have retained one&mdash;with
some of the gold he stole from poor father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Retained,&#8221; repeated Drew, turning with
sudden intentness. &#8220;Retained, is hardly the
word, Miss Loris. Hired, is more to the point.
Hired assassins are not uncommon. We have
the Becker case and the Hope murder. We
have<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew allowed his voice to trail to a whisper.
&#8220;We have,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;our man! There&#8217;s
the front door bell! It&#8217;s Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have splendid ears, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to have, Miss Stockbridge. Now,&#8221;
he added sharply, &#8220;you and Mr. Nichols go into
the library&mdash;the writing room. I think the case
is closing. There may be a little excitement if
Delaney&#8217;s got that fellow. I, for one, am not
going to stand much from him. Please go into
the other room. That&#8217;s right. Stand there,
Harry, in case we need a soldier!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew advanced step by step toward the tapestries.
He lifted his gun from his hip pocket,
examined it with narrowed eyes, then replaced
it loosely. He brushed the curtains aside and
had the key out, as heavy steps shook the upper
stairway and a knock sounded on the panels of
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! Just a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>The detective glanced through the slit in the
tapestries, saw that Nichols and Loris were
across the room, then twisted the butterfly-latch,
at the same time he thrust in the flat key
and turned the lock.</p>

<p>The door swung open. Delaney&#8217;s huge bulk
blocked the way. He half turned, cursed savagely,
and clutched a pipe-stem neck with rude
fingers. &#8220;Come along, you!&#8221; he boomed. &#8220;Get
in there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The form of a man hurtled by Drew, fell and
rose, then fell again beyond the tapestries in
the center of the sitting room. Drew, like some
lithe cat, was over him with a drawn gun. Delaney
puffed across the rugs and tried to speak
as the detective leaned and studied the chalk-pale
face below shielding cuffed hands which
were raised impotently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble-man!&#8221; exclaimed Loris fearsomely.</p>

<p>A Central Office detective slouched through
the door, deposited a kit of lineman&#8217;s tools on
the floor near the tapestries, then retired discreetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Please get back,
Miss Stockbridge. We&#8217;re going to fix this fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t strike him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;Miss Stockbridge. I&#8217;ll promise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>nothing in this connection. This is the man
who foully murdered your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris shrank back and against Nichols&#8217; extended
arm. Drew glanced at her with swift
concern. He dropped his eyes to the man at his
feet. &#8220;What happened?&#8221; he asked Delaney.
&#8220;Has this fellow said anything? Done any
talking?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney glared at the trouble-man. &#8220;Never
a word has he said, Chief. He&#8217;s a clam.
But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Go on, Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Chief, I wouldn&#8217;t have brought him
here if he hadn&#8217;t said to Morphy over the &#8217;phone
that <i>&#8217;it&#8217;</i> was fixed in her room. Now what does
he mean by that <i>&#8217;it&#8217;?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find out!&#8221; declared Drew, dropping
to the prisoner&#8217;s side.</p>

<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE PRISONER SPEAKS&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The detective wasted no time searching the
trouble-hunter&#8217;s pockets. His skilled fingers
drew forth two envelopes, a note
book and a small roll of money, the least of
which was ten-dollar bills and the greatest, on
the inside, spread out to three staring noughts
and a one in front of these.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thousand and sixty dollars!&#8221; said
Drew dryly, handing the roll to Delaney. &#8220;This
fellow&#8217;s well heeled. Perhaps for a get-a-way.
Take that. Now here<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew tapped the envelopes with his fingers,
spread them open and removed their sheets of
closely-written paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;First letter,&#8221; he announced with raising
brows, &#8220;is from Standard Electrical Co., of
Chicago, recommending Albert Jones as a capable
electrician. I don&#8217;t doubt it. He&#8217;s capable
of most anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney took the letter and waited with his
eyes fastened upon the silent figure who had not
revealed his identity from the time of the arrest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>&#8220;Second letter,&#8221; continued Drew, &#8220;is addressed
to Albert Jones, General Delivery, New
York Post Office. It is from Ossining. It is
signed Mortimer Morphy. How careless,&#8221; said
the detective, rising in his excitement. &#8220;How
<i>very</i> careless! It goes on to say that everything
is all right. That the appeal is pending with
the governor. That uncle Monty was expected
to die and that aunt Lou was very low.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew paused and glanced toward Loris and
Nichols. &#8220;You know what that means?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Uncle Monty was Mr. Montgomery
Stockbridge and aunt Lou would figure out for
you, Miss Stockbridge. Keep this, Delaney.
We&#8217;re going to convict this man right here&mdash;whether
he talks or not. This letter was written
to him two months ago. It shows premeditation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks ill,&#8221; said Loris. &#8220;His face is so
white.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dope!&#8221; snapped Drew, pressing down the
prisoner&#8217;s right eyelid and glancing at the pupil.
&#8220;A narcotic of some kind shows in the
small iris. It&#8217;s like a pin head. Yen she, eh,
Delaney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess it is, Chief. Frisk his cap and belt.
They carry it there, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew started at the prisoner&#8217;s hair and went
over his entire body with careful fingers. A
bulge, at the waist, resolved itself into a chamois
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>money-belt which contained five cartridges,
a small handful of electric fuses and a spool of
fine wire.</p>

<p>Drew eyed this last with furrowed brow. He
pocketed it finally and studied the cartridges.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two, cupronickle, center-fire,&#8221; he
announced with a hard smile. &#8220;That forges
another chain. We&#8217;re getting there. He was
loaded for something, Delaney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure and he was. Look at those handcuffs,
Chief. I made them tight as I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew handed up the cartridges and fuses and
rattled the cuffs. The prisoner protested by
turning partly over. His eyelids fluttered and
opened full upon Loris. She shrank back between
the curtains. Her hands went up to her
face in voiceless fear. &#8220;Please keep away,&#8221;
said Drew. &#8220;This man is always dangerous.
I want to trim his claws before I take any
chances with him. Delaney,&#8221; he added, &#8220;get my
overcoat and bring me those plaster-casts. This
case grows interesting. I wonder who the fellow
is? &#8216;Albert Jones&#8217; doesn&#8217;t convey much. He
is a friend and tool of Morphy. Poor Morphy!
I wonder what he&#8217;ll say when the governor gets
this evidence? He&#8217;s buried now for twenty long
years of penal service. He picked a good tool,
though. A smart man!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner did not brighten to any extent
under the professional flattery. His eyes closed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>The cuffed wrists dropped down upon his chest.
He breathed slowly as Drew took the overcoat
Delaney brought, and found the photos of the
finger prints which Fosdick and the expert at
headquarters had both declared were not on
record.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little ink,&#8221; Drew said to the operative.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll smear this fellow&#8217;s thumb and see if his
print answers to the print I found in the booth
at Grand Central. I&#8217;ll venture that it does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols extended a fountain pen which the
detective opened, sponged on the corner of a
handkerchief, and returned with a chuckle of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, gripping the prisoner&#8217;s hand
and smearing a thumb with a rolling motion
across the back of the print. &#8220;Ah, Delaney,
see here. The same whorls and loops. The
same tiny V-shaped scar. One, two, three&mdash;center
right. This is the man. We have him deeper
in toward the place with the little, green door.
He knows what I mean!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner&#8217;s lips closed to a thin, hard line.
A tiny spot of hectic fire burned in the center
of each cheek as Drew completed the searching
and rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Footprints, now!&#8221; he said with a snappy
order. &#8220;Compare those plaster casts you took
at the junction-box back of this house. Are
they the same? There&#8217;s a series of four screw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>holes in his rubber-heels, Delaney. Do they
compare with the casts. Measure them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure and they do,&#8221; said the big operative,
rising and pointing to the small projections.
&#8220;This lad, Chief, was the only one around that
junction-box till after the snow froze and drifted
over. That&#8217;s my idea, Chief. It caught him,
didn&#8217;t it, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every little helps to forge the chain,&#8221; Drew
said. &#8220;He&#8217;s in bad now. His only chance is
to tell us what he knows about Morphy? What
was said over the telephone wire? What did
Frick say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this way, Chief,&#8221; Delaney said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
waiting talking with the drug-clerk when there&#8217;s
a ring on the slot-booth &#8217;phone. It&#8217;s Jack Nefe
at Gramercy Hill. He says to me that Frick
had just &#8217;phoned and said that Morphy had
come out of the guard room, looked around,
then, after chinning with a keeper at the front
gate, he had started going over a telephone book
for a number. Nefe said for me to hold the
wire. Then I gets a number, Chief. It&#8217;s
Gramercy Hill 11,678. Nefe said that was a
booth in the new Broadway Subway at Forty-first
Street. I piles into a cab and arrives there
just as this fellow had finished boring a hole between
the two booths&mdash;11,678 and 11,679. I
waits behind a slot-machine. Some one rang
up when he coupled the wires, listens, then asks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>Gramercy Hill central for this &#8217;phone here in
Miss Stockbridge&#8217;s room. You see the game,
Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Be very clear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This fellow was connecting Morphy at state
prison with this house through the two slot
booths. I sneaked up and waited for him to
finish. He&#8217;s busy with a pair of pliers. I falls
on him like a ton of bricks. Then after I get
the cuffs on, I listens in. It&#8217;s Morphy roaring
there, with that big bull voice of his. He&#8217;s mad
&#8217;cause he gets no answer. He shouts over and
over, Chief&mdash;&#8217;Bert! Bert! Bert! Is it planted
in her room? Her room. Is it there?&#8217;&#8221; Delaney
paused and stared about the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he mean, Chief?&#8221; he asked huskily.
&#8220;What is that <i>&#8217;it&#8217;?&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; said Drew tersely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got Morphy off the wire, Chief. I got
Frick and then Frick got the warden. He&#8217;s a
good fellow. He listened to me, then he calls
some guards and they drag Morphy through the
prison and down to the coolers. I guess they&#8217;re
down in the ground, somewhere. Anyway,
Chief, he&#8217;s gone for good&mdash;unless they send him
to the chair for his part in the murder of Stockbridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go! What I want to know now, Delaney,
is this fellow&#8217;s right name. Morphy said
&#8217;Bert,&#8217; eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>&#8220;Sure he did, Chief. &#8216;Bert! Bert! Bert!&#8217;
That&#8217;s close to Albert. Albert Jones, like&#8217;s in
the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! That would be a throw-off. He&#8217;s some
other kind of a Bert. Let me see his cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney picked the prisoner&#8217;s cap from the
rug and passed it over to Drew. The detective
examined it, ripped the silk, and looked under
the lining. He straightened and handed it to
Harry Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make that name out?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Your eyes are younger than mine. Perhaps
Miss Stockbridge can read it. It&#8217;s Spanish, I
think. &#8216;Gusta&#8217; or &#8216;Gasta.&#8217; The rest is obliterated
with grease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antofagasta!&#8221; declared Loris suddenly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Antofagasta, Chile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fetch the lineman&#8217;s kit, the Central Office
man brought,&#8221; said Drew to the operative.
&#8220;Put it right here by this fellow&#8217;s side. I&mdash;we
are getting close to the truth in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney hurried back with the satchel. It was
the same one that Drew had seen in the library
on the evening Stockbridge was murdered. It
had excited no suspicion then.</p>

<p>&#8220;A magneto,&#8221; said the detective. &#8220;First
comes a ringing magneto which has seen much
service. Put that over there, Delaney. Spread
a paper or something. Ah,&#8221; Drew added,
&#8220;here&#8217;s a set of small dry batteries arranged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>in series. Three or four of them. I don&#8217;t
know just what they&#8217;re for, but Bert does.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner&#8217;s pale eyes blinked and were
closed again as the lids compressed in wrinkled
determination. He moved slightly when Drew
pressed a knee against his chest. He coughed
with dry catching deep down in his throat. The
detective felt of his pulse. It was faint but
steady&mdash;like a tired sleeper&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming out of it,&#8221; Drew said. &#8220;He&#8217;ll
talk after awhile. Let&#8217;s see, what is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney leaned over the satchel. &#8220;Another
link,&#8221; said Drew, drawing out a telephone receiver
without wires attached to it. &#8220;And
here,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is the testing set with the
sharp clamps. That&#8217;s for listening in or talking
with other people&#8217;s connections. I don&#8217;t doubt
that this fellow knows his business. Here&#8217;s a
micro-volt meter that registers fractions of
volts. Here&#8217;s an ammeter of the pocket size.
I&#8217;ve seen this kind on automobiles for testing
dry-cells. Now, what is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a full set of jimmies!&#8221; blurted
Delaney. &#8220;That&#8217;s a sectional jimmy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got everything,&#8221; said the detective,
turning and glancing at Loris. &#8220;Here, Miss
Stockbridge,&#8221; he said, holding up an empty
cartridge shell. &#8220;Here is the most important
link in the chain against him. It&#8217;s a twenty-two
shell which has been fired. See&mdash;wait&mdash;what&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>this, Delaney? The cap on the end hasn&#8217;t been
struck. The cartridge was discharged&mdash;the cap
is intact. How could that be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris and Harry Nichols leaned over the detective.
He turned the tiny shell around in his
fingers. He sniffed it. He held it out so they
could see the end. &#8220;Discharged,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;without touching the detonating cap on the
end! That&#8217;s odd! Very suggestive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see it,&#8221; said Nichols. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell.
We have exams on these things. This seems to
have been fired,&#8221; he continued with thought.
&#8220;It&#8217;s been fired without concussion. I&#8217;d say it
was heat that did it. A match touched to the
base here would fire the cap, which would, in
turn, set off the powder. There&#8217;s a different
color to the brass at the cap end. It looks to
me like a shell which has been clamped down
by three&mdash;no, four screws. There&#8217;s marks on
the rim. See them, Loris&mdash;Miss Stockbridge?
Right there. Right at my nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about right, Harry!&#8221; declared Drew,
reaching for the cartridge. &#8220;It was clamped
down with small screws. It was ignited or set
off by heat. It forms part of a home-made pistol
which conforms, to a hair, with Fosdick&#8217;s
statement that the bullet never went through a
barrel that was rifled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s your own statement!&#8221; blurted Delaney.
&#8220;Fosdick never had brains enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>figure a thing out like that. All he knows is
pinch everybody two or three times. I&#8217;ve seen
him do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew eyed the prisoner. &#8220;So you see,&#8221; he
said softly, cuttingly, &#8220;crime does not pay.
The net has closed over your head. You erred
a score of times. You couldn&#8217;t afford to make
one little mistake. I could&mdash;I did! I&#8217;ve made
a hundred in this case already! It&#8217;s the hound
and the hare. The hound loses the scent and
brays on blunderingly till he picks it up again.
You lost me time and again. You fooled me
in that lineman&#8217;s guise when you came into
the library. Your make-up was perfect. You
said just the right things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner&#8217;s lips curled in a thin cruel line.
He rattled the cuffs defiantly. His shoulders
lifted then fell back upon the rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert!&#8221; snapped Drew. &#8220;Bert!&#8221; he repeated
with awakening thought. &#8220;Delaney,&#8221; he
said, turning and glancing up at the operative&#8217;s
broad, flushed face. &#8220;I got this fellow located.
What was the name of the man we tried to find
in the Morphy failure? The one we had a bench-warrant
for? He was indicted. The indictment
was sealed. You know! It&#8217;s a name you didn&#8217;t
like. The fellow who escaped to Rio or South
America? Who afterwards went to Antofagasta. Ah, Cuthbert!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, Chief! Cutbert! Cutbert Morphy&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>old devil&#8217;s brother. This is him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rubbed his hands vigorously. &#8220;It is!&#8221;
he exclaimed, with his eyes swinging over the
prisoner&#8217;s drawn features. &#8220;Cuthbert Morphy&mdash;a
brother&#8217;s tool and confederate. We&#8217;re
getting on!&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective rose and faced Loris and Nichols.
&#8220;Captain,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a firing squad at sunrise
would be the Army&#8217;s answer to this man&#8217;s
deviltry. Consider what he has done. He&#8217;s
worked back to New York after a year as a
fugitive. He connected in some manner with
Morphy at Sing Sing. Perhaps he went there
as a visitor under the pretext of business connected
with Morphy&#8217;s affairs. This scheme was
hatched there in the prison. It was financed by
Morphy. It succeeded in so far as Mr. Stockbridge
was concerned. First the telephone call
to the cemetery superintendent. Then followed
his visit to this house for the purpose of fixing
some fiendish device. Or<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He might have fixed the windows, Chief,&#8221;
suggested Delaney. &#8220;He might have opened a
catch and climbed in afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t near the windows,&#8221; said Drew.
&#8220;He had something else in the back of his
crafty, twisted brain. He came and went out,
with Mr. Stockbridge and I watching him. He
called up, then, and threatened the death. He
probably looped the library &#8217;phone up with Sing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>Sing at or about midnight. We have a record
of both calls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; asked Loris, as Drew paused in
thought. &#8220;Why did he have Morphy connected
with father? I can&#8217;t see, Mr. Drew, that
part of it. The rest, you have told is, is very
clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I yet,&#8221; admitted the detective. &#8220;But
that is a detail. It is probably the criminal&#8217;s
ego, which is in every one of them, to notify
their prey that the hour has come. Morphy was
an artist in crime. He was a master mind in
finance and chicanery. What better revenge
could he think of than to notify Mr. Stockbridge
that death was about to strike? It savors of
Machiavelli and Borgia. Whom the gods destroy
they first make mad. He tried it on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gods!&#8221; blurted Delaney with ire. &#8220;Devils,
you mean, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, or worse!&#8221; said Drew, glancing sternly
at the prisoner. &#8220;This fellow,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;is the agent for the destroyer. Now how was
it done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney glanced about the walls of the room
in apprehension. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take another look
around,&#8221; he suggested heavily. &#8220;Maybe with
them new ideas we can locate something that
might be planted for the killing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced sharply at the prisoner&#8217;s face.
A faint sneer was on the thin lips. The wrists
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>twisted and turned in the handcuffs. The steel
chain rattled metallically. Loris backed step after
step toward the shielding curtain and Harry
Nichols. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said suddenly, as she
dropped her head against his breast. &#8220;Oh, Harry!
there can&#8217;t be anything like <i>that.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; Drew hastened to ejaculate.
&#8220;That&#8217;s nonsense. If there was anything planted
in either of these three rooms, there&#8217;s no
one to get in and operate it. I&#8217;ve searched!
Mr. Delaney has searched. Do you want us to
search again?&#8221; Drew&#8217;s lips were drawn with
doubt as he stared anxiously from Loris to
Nichols. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it, captain, if you say so. I
think we&#8217;ve done enough work, however. The
thing is to get this fellow to talk. I don&#8217;t want
to give him over to Fosdick and the third degree
till we see if he is going to treat us right.
He can turn state&#8217;s evidence on Morphy, who
blundered. Then he&#8217;ll get off lightly. Morphy
is the master mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He only smiles,&#8221; said Nichols, tapping his
breast suggestively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a gun here and I&#8217;ve
a mind to use it. Do you think I want Miss
Stockbridge murdered like her father was murdered?
I&#8217;ll shoot that cur! He&#8217;s a whispering
snake! A Hun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; sobbed Loris, as Nichols thrust his
hand in his coat and drew out a flat automatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>of .44 caliber. &#8220;Don&#8217;t, Harry! Perhaps this
man is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Innocent!&#8221; declared Nichols. &#8220;Why, Loris&mdash;why,
Miss Stockbridge, you don&#8217;t think
<i>that</i>, after all the things Mr. Drew has discovered.
I&#8217;ll wager my commission he&#8217;s guilty as
Hell, and I mean it, Loris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s that!&#8221; Delaney declared. &#8220;He and his
brother the devil are one in sin. They&#8217;re lost
spirits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now everybody,&#8221; said Drew, gathering in
the group with his eyes, which were strangely
bright. &#8220;Everybody keep very quiet for a minute.
Let me think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure and I will, Chief. I&#8217;m thinking I want
to think, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew frowned at Delaney. He dropped his
eyes and studied the prisoner&#8217;s hands. They
were strangely white and remarkably small for
a man who had labored at telephone-repairing.
The detective&#8217;s glance rested on the ink-stained
thumb. His mind swung with this thought to
the footprints. Following the train he arrived
at the first conclusion that an expert in telephony
could devise most any kind of a practical
method for opening a window or a ventilator.
He dismissed this theory with a glance about
the room. The ventilator was well-hidden and
inaccessible to any one without a step-ladder.
Considerable time devoted in climbing upon a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>chair and a case of jade ornaments might reach
it, but the trouble-man had not been alone in
the room when he inspected the telephone.</p>

<p>Drew went over the salient details of the
Stockbridge tragedy. One fact stood out. The
windows had been well locked. The sashes were
covered with snow. A climber, even on the face
of the house, would have difficulty in springing
a catch by a secret method, raising the window
and entering without leaving a track of some
kind. He dismissed this supposition as untenable.
He turned to Delaney, fully puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there a climber&#8217;s set in that bag?&#8221; he
asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any, Chief. I don&#8217;t think this
fellow&#8217;s a climber. He ain&#8217;t built like one. His
shoes are smooth on the bottom and his hands
are all polished up around the nails. Looks to
me, Chief, as if he might be able to pick most
any kind of a lock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The locks are out of the question!&#8221; snapped
Drew. &#8220;I examined them. They&#8217;re not in line.
Has anybody here any suggestions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew stared at the prisoner&#8217;s drawn, white
face as he asked this question. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t
long in this part of the house,&#8221; said the captain.
&#8220;The maid watched him. She thought
perhaps he might take something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fosdick is to blame!&#8221; said Drew almost
losing his temper. &#8220;He should have given strict
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>orders at the door not to let anybody in till
the case was settled. It&#8217;s all mixed up now.
This man had ample opportunity to cover himself.
A clever sneak could do most anything
under your eyes without you seeing him operate.
I suppose the only thing to do is to turn
him over to Headquarters. He&#8217;ll get his!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris frowned slightly at Drew&#8217;s manner.
The detective did not act like his former self.
She watched him pace the floor between the prisoner
and the tapestries. He came back with a
square set to his jaw and a hard glint in his
olive eyes which gleamed like steel behind velvet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand him up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney stared at his chief. He opened his
mouth, then closed it firmly. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he
said, reaching down. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand him up if you
let me give him an upper-cut. I don&#8217;t like these
silent crooks. They&#8217;re snaky, Chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No unnecessary violence, gentlemen,&#8221; suggested
Nichols as Loris laid her hand on his
arm. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have him alone for a few
minutes&mdash;but outside. Go easy. Perhaps he&#8217;ll
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be your life or this man&#8217;s!&#8221; gritted
Drew, stepping up to the prisoner after a sharp
glance at Loris. &#8220;I pity him when Fosdick gets
hold of him. He&#8217;ll talk then!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner swayed with Delaney&#8217;s fingers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>gripping his collar in a vice-strong clutch. His
white-pale face, his narrow-set eyes, his furtive
glance to left and right like a cornered rat,
brought Drew to mind of a man who was slowly
breaking down. He lowered his brows and
clutched the prisoner&#8217;s elbow with strong fingers
that pressed deep through the coat sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it!&#8221; he demanded harshly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
your last chance to save your miserable skin.
You&#8217;re not going to get any mercy from the
Commissioner. You know what he&#8217;ll do to
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner twisted loose from Drew&#8217;s
clutch. His eyes wavered as he stared at Loris
for a long second, then dropped to the floor.
They closed in painful thought. Suddenly he
blanched with passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no use for you coppers!&#8221; he screamed
shrillingly. &#8220;I hate the sight of you and your
kind. Let me go! Let me go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine chance,&#8221; whispered Delaney, tightening
his grip on the prisoner&#8217;s collar. &#8220;You
got a fine chance, you murderin&#8217;, thievin&#8217;, second-story
man! I&#8217;d paste you if the lady wasn&#8217;t
here! Sure I would, right between the eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Leave him to me.
He&#8217;s thinking the thing over. I don&#8217;t mind
telling him that the magpie beat him. That
and the carelessness of Morphy in calling up
when he must have known that Frick was in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>front office of the prison. It&#8217;s always the way,
Bert. He travels the fastest, up or down, who
travels alone. It&#8217;s the lone star that gives us
the trouble. There&#8217;s nobody to peach on him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner bit his upper lip. A slight
sign of blood showed. He tasted this with the
tip of his tongue. His eyes narrowed in calculation.
He turned and faced Drew with slit-lidded
intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done a thing,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got a thing on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; blurted Drew with heat. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
got a thing. I&#8217;ve been asleep since the time
you murdered this girl&#8217;s father. I&#8217;ve had ten
men on your trail since the beginning. I don&#8217;t
hold the first murder so much against you as
I do the projected one&mdash;which missed fire by a
scant margin. You slayed a man with your
devilish ingenuity, but you&#8217;re not going to put
it over on his daughter. I&#8217;ve seen to that! I
notice nobody has called up and said this was
the Master talking. There&#8217;s a good reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner fluttered his pale lashes and
glanced at the telephone. He closed his eyes
with a smile shadowing his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good reason,&#8221; repeated Drew.
&#8220;You are not in some booth at Forty-first
Street to make the connection. Morphy is in
the strongest cooler. He&#8217;s booked for twenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>years. After that he&#8217;ll get more. He can&#8217;t
help you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you coppers,&#8221; said the trouble-man.
&#8220;Just give me five minutes and I&#8217;d show you.
I don&#8217;t hold anything against the girl. I never
saw her before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take these cuffs off-a-me? I
can&#8217;t hit back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d sooner take the chance outside,&#8221; said
Drew, glancing at Loris. &#8220;I&#8217;d do it there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney tightened his grip and half held the
trouble-hunter in the air. He raised on his toes
with the strain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Loris. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
ask you to stop this. I can&#8217;t let it occur in my
house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stockbridge,&#8221; said Drew with soft rebuke.
&#8220;Miss Stockbridge, I&#8217;ve been in the detective
business for twenty years. I never saw
in that time a more dangerous man. He is the
super-type who usually falls through the errors
of other men. This fellow has brains. He&#8217;s
an expert in telephony and in wireless. There
are a number of patents in the patent office under
his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he may be innocent, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s as guilty as the Kaiser!&#8221; exclaimed
Delaney, twisting the prisoner around. &#8220;Look
at him. He&#8217;s been trying to murder the finest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>little lady in the country. She never harmed
anybody. She&#8217;s devoting most of her time to
Red Cross work and the&mdash;Army,&#8221; added the
big operative with a touch of brogue as he
glanced at Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has not said that he murdered father,&#8221;
said Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure an&#8217; he won&#8217;t say it. I know the breed
of this snake. He wants nothing used against
him in the trial. He&#8217;ll have the evidence of us
four to show that he didn&#8217;t say anything. I
never saw an innocent man who wouldn&#8217;t talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting nowhere,&#8221; objected Drew,
taking command of the situation. &#8220;Take him
out, Delaney, and turn him over to the Central
Office bunch. They&#8217;ll take him down to
Fosdick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner lifted his manacled hands. He
dropped them after a slow glance at Drew&#8217;s
square jaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Delaney with a jerk backward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew and Nichols leaned forward. &#8220;Well?&#8221;
asked the detective, as the prisoner bowed his
head. &#8220;Well? Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that true about my brother&mdash;Morphy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; Drew said with ringing conviction.
&#8220;It&#8217;s true! He&#8217;s out of this world. He&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>buried alive and the key has been thrown
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The jig is up, then,&#8221; said the trouble-man,
turning toward the telephone. &#8220;Let me telephone,&#8221;
he said in a whisper. &#8220;I want to use
it,&#8221; he repeated faintly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you how
that&mdash;that Stockbridge died.&#8221;</p>

<div>
<a id='ch15'></a>
<p class='line mt3 center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p>
<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE VOICE ON THE WIRE&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>The prisoner lifted his manacled hands and
held them toward Drew. &#8220;Let me loose,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll explain everything
that I&#8217;ve done! I want it off my mind. I won&#8217;t
sleep until you people are satisfied. I know
you&mdash;you copper! I know Fosdick&mdash;the third
degree artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew frowned as he glanced at the cuffs. He
scratched his dark hair and combed his fingers
back toward his ears. He turned and glanced
at Loris and Nichols in the opening between the
two splendid rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to take a chance with this fellow,&#8221;
he admitted. &#8220;Do you want me to, Miss
Stockbridge? It&#8217;s your life he was after, and
he may be shamming now. You never can trust
an opium addict. They have no soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve as much as a copper&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, you!&#8221; boomed Delaney, threateningly.
&#8220;Shut up! There&#8217;s a lady in this
room!&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner clicked his cuffs together. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>stared at the cheval glass and the telephone.
&#8220;A lady?&#8221; he repeated through the corner of
his lips. &#8220;A limb of the Stockbridge tree,&#8221; he
said bitterly. &#8220;I hold nothing against her. I
told you that before. But we promised the old
man we&#8217;ll take care of her after we killed him,
and she came near going&mdash;let me tell you that.
I could have killed her with twenty words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rambling,&#8221; said Delaney, reaching for
the prisoner. &#8220;The dope has gone to his head.
I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, Delaney,&#8221; warned Drew thoroughly
on the alert. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make the mistake of underestimating
this fellow. He acts like a man
who has repented&mdash;who wants to right some of
the wrong he has done. I don&#8217;t think we are
taking chances in letting this fellow loose. He
is unarmed. I tended to that. If he wants to
&#8217;phone&mdash;let&#8217;s let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your case, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew reached in his pocket and brought
around a police regulation revolver. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
this right here!&#8221; he snapped as he slowly
raised it. &#8220;You, Delaney, unlock one cuff and
pass it to me. I&#8217;ll wrap the chain around my
left wrist. If this fellow tries anything I&#8217;ll
tend to his case&mdash;forever. These .44&#8217;s are
made for stopping purposes, eh, Mr. Nichols?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They certainly are, Mr. Drew. I think we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>can handle that little man without trouble.
What does he want to telephone for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for, Bert?&#8221; asked Drew, swinging and
confronting the prisoner. &#8220;Do you want to
say good-by to somebody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by is right,&#8221; whispered the trouble-man,
extending his hands toward Delaney, who
fished out a small key. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s good-by to
somebody. Unlock them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; exclaimed Drew. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like
that tone. You&#8217;ll have to act better than that,
Bert. What do you want to get loose for?
What number do you want? I&#8217;ll call up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I got to do it. I want one hand free&mdash;that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris stepped to Drew&#8217;s side. &#8220;Can there
be anything about the room,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;that
he wants to use? Perhaps he&#8217;ll pick something
up and use it too quickly for you to stop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; said Drew grimly. &#8220;This
gun, Miss Stockbridge, happens to have a hair
trigger. We&#8217;ll chance it&mdash;with your permission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid for myself&mdash;but don&#8217;t you
think the poor fellow should be prevented from
harming himself. He acts just like a man who
wanted to do something terrible. He seems to
have given up hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s intuition,&#8221; mused Drew. &#8220;Perhaps
a close one,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;You get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>back into the other room, Miss Stockbridge.
Let Mr. Nichols stand in front of you for protection.
I&#8217;m going to grant this fellow&#8217;s request.
Delaney, unlock the left cuff!&#8221;</p>

<p>The key rattled in the tiny key-hole as Drew
poised his revolver and drew a sight between
the prisoner&#8217;s fluttering eyelids. &#8220;Stand right
there,&#8221; whispered the detective tersely. &#8220;Right
there,&#8221; he added, reaching with his left hand
and taking the cuff and chain from the operative.
&#8220;Now, Bert, you&#8217;re half free. What do
you want with the telephone?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner pinched his wrist and worked
his hand like a hinge. A white mark, which
slowly changed to red, showed where Delaney
had clamped the handcuff down to its last notch.
The trouble-man eyed this mark. His lips
hardened. He strained on the chain as he lifted
his fingers to his brow with a tired gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Hurry, Bert, or
we&#8217;ll cuff you up again. Do you want to telephone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y&mdash;e&mdash;s!&#8221; The voice was tremulous and
dry. &#8220;Yes! I&#8217;ll use it. I&#8217;ll show you how
that pirate&mdash;Stockbridge&mdash;was killed. The yellow
squealer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris raised her chin proudly. She leaned
against Nichols in the doorway. &#8220;I won&#8217;t stand
for that!&#8221; declared the soldier. &#8220;You are being
insulted in your own house!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>&#8220;Wait, Harry! Something is going to happen!
I know it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, lady,&#8221; whispered the prisoner.
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to happen to&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t
care. I&#8217;m done. The jig is up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cuthbert Morphy shrugged his shoulders and
turned toward Drew. He stared at the menacing
revolver with a cryptic smile. &#8220;Get your
man downstairs,&#8221; he said, in hollow tones.
&#8220;Get him to go in the library and call up this
number. Tell Central to connect the two &#8217;phones
in this house. Shout into the library transmitter
when the connection is made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew frowned. &#8220;What&#8217;s all that for?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I give orders here.
What do you want that done for? I thought
you wanted a number on the &#8217;phone. I thought
you would get somebody on the wire who would
explain everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything will be explained, Inspector.
Everything! I told you the jig was up with
me. I mean it, too. There&#8217;s nothing left but
the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew wound the handcuff chain tighter about
his left wrist. He braced his feet and turned
to Delaney. &#8220;Go downstairs,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
call up this number. Do what this fellow says.
The number is Gramercy Hill 9764.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>Loris and Nichols lifted their brows as they
turned toward each other. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said
the girl. &#8220;Something is not right, Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;ll ever find out what
this man means. If they take him away without
letting him talk over the &#8217;phone we&#8217;ll never
know. Leave things to Mr. Drew. He&#8217;s armed!
I&#8217;m armed! There&#8217;s no danger!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get downstairs to the library!&#8221; Drew ordered.
&#8220;Do what this man wants. Shout into
the transmitter. Go now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney lunged through the tapestries and
unlocked the door to the hall. He paused there
in thought. He turned and glanced back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; exclaimed Drew. &#8220;Hurry now!&#8221;</p>

<p>The big operative cursed audibly as he descended
the two flights of carpeted steps. He
nodded to the Central Office man at the library
door. He passed inside, rounded the table and
stood by the &#8217;phone. He picked up the receiver.
His eyes wandered along the floor as he waited.
A dark spot showed on the hardwood. It was
where the millionaire&#8217;s blood had gushed forth
from the bullet hole in the base of his brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gramercy Hill 9-7-6-4!&#8221; said Delaney with
a bull&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;B-r-r-r-r-! B-r-r-r-r-! B-r-r-r-r-r!&#8221; sounded
from the ringing-box of the silver plated telephone
in the sitting-room of Loris Stockbridge&#8217;s
suite.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>The prisoner pulled at the chain as he leaned
toward the telephone. &#8220;It&#8217;s ringing,&#8221; he said
in a thin whisper. &#8220;Let me&mdash;let me listen in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew studied the entire situation before he
granted permission. Loris and Nichols were
framed between the silken portières. The captain
held his army regulation revolver at his
hip. Loris leaned forward with her dark eyes
smoldering and intent. The blood had left her
cheeks. They were white and tersely set. She
seemed older to Drew. He smiled reassuringly,
dropped his gun to his hip, pressed it against
the prisoner and shoved him toward the &#8217;phone
as a &#8220;B-r-r-r-r-&#8221; sounded above the lifting roar
of Delaney&#8217;s voice in the depths of the great
mansion.</p>

<p>The room became charged and surcharged
with electricity. A crackling sounded as Drew&#8217;s
feet glided inch by inch over the silk rug. The
storm outside whined and synchronized with
the rise and fall of the great voice shouting
&#8220;Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello, you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble-man turned. His hand reached
upward and lifted the hard-rubber receiver
from the hook. His lids fluttered toward Loris.
His eyes softened with memories. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
I didn&#8217;t do it!&#8221; he hissed across the room.
&#8220;Good-by, lady&mdash;good-by!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; snapped Drew, pressing the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>revolver firmly against the prisoner&#8217;s right side.
&#8220;Be careful! This is a hair trigger!&#8221;</p>

<p>The trouble-man smiled a twisted, wan smile
as he turned his head toward the transmitter
and said huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Hello! You big copper! Shout on!
See how loud you can curse me! That&#8217;s it.
That&mdash;is&mdash;it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew heard Delaney&#8217;s voice rise in indignation.
The taunt had spurned him to greater
effort. The metallic diaphragm of the receiver
roared and clicked. It echoed the voice. It
stopped. It vibrated again. It reached a reed-like
tune of high-pitched anger. The prisoner
closed his eyes and stiffened. He pressed the
receiver directly over his ear. He drew back on
the chain and to one side. Drew&#8217;s face darkened
with suspicion. It was too late. The detective
had time to spring away as a cone of
lurid light and flame shot out from the telephone
diaphragm and splashed across the prisoner&#8217;s
set face. A sharp detonation racked the
perfumed air of the room. Smoke wreathed
about the astonished Inspector&#8217;s head, and
floated upward toward the ventilator.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Morphy&#8217;s muscles relaxed. He
spun, sank to his knees, then pitched forward
across the rug with a bullet in his brain. Drew
untwisted the chain with a wrist flip, sprang
forward toward the cheval-glass, and stamped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>his foot down upon the smoking telephone receiver
as if it were the head of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>He turned with clear light striking out from
his eyes. He nodded toward the leaning form
of the girl and the erect one of the captain.
He divined in seconds how the murder of Montgomery
Stockbridge had been accomplished.
The full series of events and clues flashed
through his brain. It was like an orderly array
seen at a picture show.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Morphy, guised as a trouble-hunter
in the employ of the telephone company, had
devised a single-shot pistol out of a telephone
receiver and had caused it to be actuated by the
human voice so that it would always strike in
the most vulnerable part of man&#8217;s anatomy&mdash;the
ear.</p>

<p>With this lethal instrument he had slain the
millionaire, and, when trapped and in danger
of execution, he had employed the same method
to bring about his own death. It was a fitting
end to a life of crime and drug-brought imageries.</p>

<p>Delaney, with drawn gun and wild of eyes,
burst through the tapestries and brought up
with a dizzy lurch before the body of Cuthbert
Morphy. He stammered and glared downward.
He swung his heavy chin and stared at Loris
and Nichols in the gloom of the further curtains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>He clapped Drew on the shoulder with
a heavy hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had to shoot him, eh, Chief? What&#8217;d he
try? What&mdash;you got your foot on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An electric pistol,&#8221; said Drew, with a grim
smile distending his olive-hued lips. &#8220;An infernal
machine, Delaney. I hope it isn&#8217;t a repeater.
Cut that wire! Both wires! Get your
knife out and cut through them, quick! I won&#8217;t
take any chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>The big operative pocketed his revolver with
a back swing of his right hand, brought it forward
empty and ran it down his trouser pocket.
He brought out a buck-horn jack-knife, pried
it open, stooped and slashed through the two
silk cords holding the receiver to the bottom of
the transmitter which had fallen from the
bracket.</p>

<p>Loris swayed with supple limbs. She raised
her hands and pressed her unjeweled fingers
against her face. She sobbed once, then turned
and threw herself upon Nichols&#8217; drab shoulder.
&#8220;Harry,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh, Harry&mdash;what happened?
I didn&#8217;t see what happened!&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain glided an arm about her waist
and half-carried, half-led her to a couch in the
reading-room. &#8220;Rest here a minute,&#8221; he said,
leaning down. &#8220;Be cool and as brave as you
can. The trouble-man won&#8217;t trouble you any
longer. He took his own medicine!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>Nichols returned to the sitting room in time
to hear Drew exclaim, after Delaney had
reached down and lifted the receiver, &#8220;The case
is closed! This closes it with a bang! Give
me that electric pistol, Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative handed it over. &#8220;Get a big
rug,&#8221; ordered Drew with sudden thought.
&#8220;Cover that fellow over till we call the Central
Office men and the coroner. I want to examine
this receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here on this little table would be a
good place,&#8221; suggested Nichols, lifting off a
handful of ivory ornaments and depositing
them on top of a glass case. &#8220;I&#8217;ll spread a paper
here. I&#8217;d like to see what&#8217;s inside that
thing myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about electricity or
telephony?&#8221; asked Drew, as he turned the hard-rubber
receiver in his hand and stared at the
listening end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little, Inspector. But fire-arms are in
my line and that seems to be one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective nodded. &#8220;It&#8217;s one, all right,&#8221;
he said, holding it out with a steady hand.
&#8220;Looks harmless, don&#8217;t it? Two binding-posts
on one end. A rubber cap on the other. Notice
that diaphragm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols took the receiver and squinted at the
rubber cap. &#8220;By George!&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is
odd. There&#8217;s a tiny hole drilled or punched in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>the center. It&#8217;s about the same size as the
bore of a twenty-two caliber revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at your hands!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;What
the devil,&#8221; he added with dawning conviction.
&#8220;Say, Delaney, do you remember that spot of
black under my left ear. The one you noticed
after we left yesterday morning? The<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, Chief. That&#8217;s where you got the smut&mdash;from that receiver!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got it when I picked up the telephone in
the library downstairs and tried to get Central.
Do you remember how long she took? This is
the same receiver in all probability. The trouble-hunter
removed it from the library connections,
loaded it, and brought it up here. It looks
like any ordinary receiver. The telephone company
have some with binding posts and some
without. This is an earlier model.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The spot of black was from the first discharge
when Stockbridge was killed!&#8221; exclaimed
Delaney.</p>

<p>Drew ran his fingers around the inner rim of
the rubber cap. He held them up. &#8220;See!&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;No wonder my neck was marked.
That settles that mystery, Delaney. If we
had any brains at all we would have connected
the soot and the telephone. If we had done
that we&#8217;d have solved the case early this morning,
or yesterday morning. It&#8217;s after one,
now!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>&#8220;This hole,&#8221; said Nichols, &#8220;was the only
thing in the whole dastardly scheme that could
have been seen. It&#8217;s the size of the end of a
lead pencil. Funny you didn&#8217;t notice it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked everywhere but there,&#8221; admitted
Drew. &#8220;The receiver hangs with the diaphragm
end down. That&#8217;s the reason I didn&#8217;t see it.
Well&mdash;there&#8217;s always a reason,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;Now, Delaney, fetch me that trouble-hunter&#8217;s
satchel. We&#8217;ll see what this pistol is made of
and how it is made. I venture to say that it
is simple.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney awoke from his stupor and lifted a
rug which he tossed over the body of Cuthbert
Morphy. He wiped his hands with a finite motion.
He wheeled and slouched lankily across
the polished floor. He returned with the lineman&#8217;s
kit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pliers,&#8221; said Drew, as the big operative removed
the straps and reached his hand inside.
&#8220;I saw a pair there when we had it open before,&#8221;
the detective added, unscrewing the rubber
cap of the receiver and lifting the thin
metal diaphragm from the face of two tiny magnets
which were wound with fine silk wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Regulation magnets,&#8221; whispered Nichols,
leaning over the detective&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;They&#8217;re
regulation except there&#8217;s a hole drilled down
between them. There must be a barrel all the
way through the receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see. Got those pliers, Delaney?&#8221;</p>

<p>The operative passed up a pair. &#8220;Ah,&#8221;
chuckled the detective, unscrewing the binding-posts
and lifting off a hard rubber cap. &#8220;Ah,
see here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney rose and peered over the captain&#8217;s
shoulder straps. The two men watched Drew&#8217;s
nimble fingers trace out the mechanism of the
electric pistol.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simple!&#8221; declared the detective. &#8220;It&#8217;s
very simple and ingenious in construction. It&#8217;s
a crowning wonder to me that some one hasn&#8217;t
used this sort of device to carry out a wholesale
slaughtering. Suppose they never thought
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew glanced at the silent mound under the
Persian rug. &#8220;The wrong road,&#8221; he whispered
tersely. &#8220;He took the wrong road. He was a
mechanical and electrical genius. He was a
patent expert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney worked his brows up and down.
&#8220;Shall I call Miss Stockbridge?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; Nichols said, turning and hurrying
through the portières. He returned with
Loris leaning upon his arm. Her eyes were
glazed and tear-laden. She held a tiny, limp
lace handkerchief between her trembling fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Come
here, Miss Stockbridge,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I want
to show you what was all ready for you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>The detective raised the hard-rubber receiver.
&#8220;Here we have the diaphragm,&#8221; he said, pointing.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a round plate of soft iron. It&#8217;s secured
to the rubber by an insulated ring. It is
the part you press up to your ear when you
listen at a telephone. There&#8217;s a small hole
punched in this one. The same sized hole extends
down through the center core, or magnet.
This hole isn&#8217;t rifled. It couldn&#8217;t well be rifled
save with special machinery. That&#8217;s why the
bullet found in Mr. Stockbridge&#8217;s brain was
without longitudinal scorings. It was fired
from a smooth-bored pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you thought!&#8221; blurted Delaney
with loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at sea,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;we have a live cartridge at the opposite
end of this core from the diaphragm. See
it?&#8221; Loris leaned over the little table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right here!&#8221; The detective pointed.
&#8220;That is a twenty-two cartridge with a cupronickle
bullet. See the cap? See how it is held
from coming back by those tiny screws about
the rim?&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris nodded and gathered up her straying
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Drew. &#8220;Now, this cartridge
was exploded by the action of the human
voice. Here&#8217;s a tiny spiral of very slender
platinum wire. It must be number forty, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>least. That&#8217;s very fine! This spiral is in series
with the winding about the magnets. The same
current pulsated by the human voice which actuates
the receiver diaphragm, also passed
through this spiral. Now,&#8221; Drew paused.
&#8220;Now,&#8221; he added with rising voice, &#8220;here is a
tiny charred piece of match-head, I guess. It
was set in the coil. It flared when the wire became
hot. The heat was sufficient to ignite the
cap. See it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see it!&#8221; exclaimed Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;The action is simple,&#8221; continued Drew. &#8220;A
pulsation of the current which was formed by
the action of the vibrating, transmitter diaphragm,
also pulsated the fine wire before it
went to the receiver magnets. The louder the
voice into the transmitter the more current&mdash;measured
in fractions of amperes&mdash;passed
through the spiral. It became sufficiently hot
to flare the piece of match-head or whatever
Cuthbert placed there. This flare was communicated
to the percussion cap, or fulminate of
mercury, at the base of the cartridge. This exploded
the powder charge, which in turn projected
the cupronickle bullet forward through
the tube or the bore of the receiver and out
through the thin, metal diaphragm, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked the operative.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out through the hole in the diaphragm,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>continued Drew, &#8220;and right into your ear or my
ear, Delaney!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not into mine!&#8221; exclaimed the operative.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll never telephone as long as I live, Chief!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all be careful,&#8221; said Nichols, turning
toward Loris.</p>

<p>Drew gathered together the different parts
of the telephone receiver. &#8220;Evidence against
Morphy,&#8221; he said dryly, as he dropped them
into the side pocket of his coat. &#8220;They are our
Exhibit A if he ever finishes that twenty years
in the cooler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris reached out her hand. &#8220;You saved my
life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You saved it, Mr. Drew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I blundered and blundered and blundered
on this case,&#8221; admitted the detective frankly.
&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to request you to wait a few
minutes before I call the coroner. Delaney has
some questions. I feel sure he wants to ask me
one or two.&#8221;</p>

<p class='line mb2 center'>&#8220;THE END&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Triggy Drew&#8217;s eyes shone with triumphant
fire as he turned and faced the
group gathered in the sitting room.</p>

<p>He adjusted his coat lapels, clicked his heels
and smiled politely. His hand strayed up to his
short-cropped mustache which was still neat
and well-trimmed despite the labors of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although the case is practically closed,&#8221; he
said with concern, &#8220;there are features which
are not entirely cleared up&mdash;even in my mind.
Perhaps we have a little time,&#8221; he added, glancing
at his watch. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go into the other room&mdash;away from these
memories&mdash;and have a cup
of tea, if Miss Stockbridge will be so kind as to
order some.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris glanced at Nichols. She nodded as she
turned toward Drew. He moved over to the
rug which covered Cuthbert Morphy&#8217;s body. He
stooped and adjusted this. He rose and
dimmed the lights by snapping off two of the
switches and turning a bulb in its socket. He
hesitated as he glanced at the telephone wires
which Delaney had cut.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>&#8220;Central will wonder what has happened,&#8221;
he said half aloud. &#8220;The connections leading
to this house have given them a lot of trouble
in the last few hours. I suppose they haven&#8217;t
another trouble-man like this one, though?&#8221;
Drew pointed toward the shadowed rug which
gleamed with silk and rare woven designs.</p>

<p>Loris raised her hand and grasped the portières.
She shuddered slightly. She allowed
her eyes to wander over the room as if for a last
fleeting glance. They locked with the detective&#8217;s
own. She smiled with a plaintive droop to her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll order the tea,&#8221; she said invitingly.
&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew bowed and followed her through the
portières. Delaney already stood by the door
which led to the maid&#8217;s room. Harry Nichols
had picked up a small book and was impatiently
examining its pages. The soldier turned and
eyed the detective.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sit down?&#8221; he asked, laying the book
on a cushion. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit curious to know how
you worked out a number of things. I think
that Miss Stockbridge is, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be a detective!&#8221; exclaimed Loris,
gliding across the room and tapping with her
knuckles on the door. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you, Mr. Delaney?&#8221;
she added naïvely.</p>

<p>Delaney chuckled. &#8220;I would, Miss,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>with candor. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a regular. I&#8217;m only a
volunteer. Mr. Drew has me along to do the
heavy work. He says what I can&#8217;t lift I can
drag.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris smiled as the maid answered by opening
the door to a crack. &#8220;Tea for four,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Pekoe and tea biscuits&mdash;unless<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and widened her eyes prettily.
&#8220;Would you have anything else?&#8221; she asked
Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strong tea!&#8221; exclaimed the detective. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
take &#8216;hops,&#8217; as we call it. Make it very strong
and then we&#8217;ll settle some of these questions.
My head is none too clear. I&#8217;ve been under a
strain. I&#8217;m frank to admit that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The tea arrived within ten minutes. Drew
had prevented Delaney from &#8217;phoning for the
coroner or to Fosdick. &#8220;Some matters to clear
up,&#8221; he whispered suggestively. &#8220;We&#8217;ll leave
this place with the case entirely completed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols arranged two chairs about a tiny
teak-wood table. He had set this table within
the bay of an alcove. The space was small,
with Delaney&#8217;s big feet very much in the way.</p>

<p>Drew poised his cup and glanced from Loris
to Nichols. Their heads were very close together.
The blue-black luster of the girl&#8217;s hair
was a perfect contrast to the officer&#8217;s blond
pompadour which was slightly disarranged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>The light from above haloed with the soft fire
of frosted glass and cut prisms.</p>

<p>The detective upended the cup, drank deeply,
then passed it over to Delaney. &#8220;Another,
please,&#8221; he said, watching the operative struggling
with a saucer which was far too fragile
for his thick fingers. &#8220;One more cup,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;No sugar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris leaned from the cushion at the small of
her back and glanced toward the portières with
thought-laden eyes. &#8220;Poor misguided fellow,&#8221;
she said softly. &#8220;I feel uneasy, Mr. Drew.
Somehow or other I feel that we were partly
responsible for his death. I wish it hadn&#8217;t happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll agree with you. We must forget more
than we remember in this world. Our time is
short. The coroner and the Central Office squad
will have to be notified. I don&#8217;t doubt that
Fosdick will be surprised at the turn in the
case. He has some of your servants locked up,
you know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris pressed closer to Nichols. &#8220;I wish that
body wasn&#8217;t in there,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Suppose
he had other confederates who would break
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He worked alone,&#8221; assured Drew, finishing
the second cup and setting it down. &#8220;I found
no evidence of another crook. He worked single-handed
and single-minded. He made one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>mistake. Morphy was a bungler. A bungler is
a man who lets his artistic temperament get the
better of him. Had he allowed Cuthbert to slay
both the&mdash;Mr. Stockbridge and yourself over
the &#8217;phone, he would never have solved the case.
It was the telephoning from Sing Sing that
opened up the entire matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The inevitable slip!&#8221; exclaimed Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;They all make it. I
could tell you of a thousand instances. But
back of the inevitable slip, as you call it, is something
deeper. It has not often been mentioned
in dealing with criminals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ego! Criminal ego! Most transgressors
would go to the electric chair if the newspapers
would write enough about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris raised her brows. &#8220;Is that the reason,&#8221;
she asked, &#8220;why Morphy telephoned before
he killed poor father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; declared the detective. &#8220;Ego explains
much that we call revenge. Now,&#8221; he
added, glancing about and at a tiny clock on a
cabinet. &#8220;Now the questions from everybody!
Make them short. Mr. Delaney and I will leave
in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols glanced at Loris. &#8220;You first,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just one or two, Mr. Drew,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>&#8220;Why did that poor dead man spare my life
when he called me up the first time? He could
have killed me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I explained that. It wasn&#8217;t <i>his</i> vendetta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Vendetta?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what this case is. An almost successful
attempt to wipe out, or I should say obliterate,
the Stockbridge Family&mdash;root and
branch. Morphy had nursed the thing for over
a year. He had soured up there in prison. His
mind became abnormal. He conceived an abnormal
revenge. Also a personal one. He had
every reason to believe that he would never be
discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, Mr. Drew, he would have called me
up on the phone later and done what he did&mdash;to
father? He would have told me who he was
over the telephone, and&mdash;and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Stockbridge. Yes, be calm,
though. He is beyond the pale now. You will
never hear from him again. Be assured of
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew leaned in his chair and glanced at Delaney.
The big operative fidgeted in his seat,
squirmed, reached for the tea-pot, then drew
back his hand and started drumming the table
with his fingers.</p>

<p>Nichols disengaged his arm from behind
Loris and squared his shoulders. He moved
forward. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask a question for Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>Stockbridge,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Did you ever suspect
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; declared Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective hesitated before he answered.
His smile cleared the air as he said. &#8220;Once&mdash;for
about an hour. That was when I found out
that you were partly German. I got over it,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; declared Nichols. &#8220;I got over
the German part in no time. I enlisted!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good answer! The best one I
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney turned to his chief. He drew in his
legs. &#8220;There&#8217;s a question I&#8217;d like to ask,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That magpie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew eyed Loris. &#8220;It&#8217;s her bird now,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;She may not want it dragged back here
again. I shouldn&#8217;t think she would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Loris. &#8220;I wish that
you would explain how you followed the clew,
though. It talks so seldom, and then when it
does talk it says such nonsense it&#8217;s a perfect
enigma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That bird,&#8221; said Drew, &#8220;was the fine turning
point of the case. Before it was brought
into the office, downtown, I had no clew to start
from. There was no indication to show from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>whence the blow had fallen. Your father was
slain for a motive. He was talking to Morphy
when he died. Cuthbert had connected the two
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Through the two booths?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Through the booths at Grand Central.
Their conversation was probably a brief one.
Morphy undoubtedly gloated a minute or two,
then told Mr. Stockbridge that his time had
come on this earth. Naturally Mr. Stockbridge
asked who was talking. Morphy answered by
stating who he was, and also that he was at
Sing Sing. Mr. Stockbridge repeated this statement
aloud. He probably said, &#8216;What, Sing
Sing?&#8217; or &#8216;Ah, Ossining!&#8217; or words to that effect.
The bird heard it and remembered it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How strange!&#8221; exclaimed Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Drew, leaning forward.
&#8220;It was just like a magpie to pick out the one
salient part of a conversation and repeat it.
The couplet &#8216;Sing Sing&#8217; was one it had never
heard. It is so striking to even a bird. It probably
came with such emphasis, there was no
forgetting it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The group facing the detective was silent for
a long minute. Delaney moved uneasily as
Nichols toyed with his cup. Loris breathed in
suppressed wonder at the tiny clew which had
overthrown the best laid plans on the part of
Morphy and his confederate. It was like an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>echo of a dead voice coming back to confront a
murderer. She shivered as she widened her
eyes and stared at Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another question,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How
did the trouble-man get into this house in the
first place, Mr. Drew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was responsible. He forced my hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By a clever subterfuge. He disconnected
the library telephone wires at the junction-box
in the alley. He knew that sooner or later Mr.
Stockbridge would try to use the &#8217;phone. He
couldn&#8217;t get a connection, or I couldn&#8217;t. It was
the time I tried to &#8217;phone and then notified
Gramercy Hill Exchange through another
&#8217;phone. He was listening in and consequently
caught the gist of my orders to Harrigan. He
hurried to Gramercy Hill Exchange and there
met Frisby, another trouble-man, starting out
to investigate my complaint. He took Frisby&#8217;s
place, hurried over and closed the library connection
and then came into the house, stating
that we had sent for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever,&#8221; said Nichols. &#8220;That was clever,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remarkably so!&#8221; exclaimed Drew. &#8220;It was
a case of making the detective on the premises
act as a tool. It was like a safeblower asking
a night watchman to move a safe out on a truck.
I never suspected that fellow at all. I hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>looked at him when he was testing the connections
in the library. I even heard him rattling
a pair of pliers over the binding posts on the
receiver. That was the time he took the old
one off and put on the loaded pistol. It was
done very quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective paused and glanced at his
watch. &#8220;We must go,&#8221; he said, staring at Loris
with soft interest. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re keeping
you from your sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I want to ask you another question,&#8221;
she said eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;m still in doubt about the
slot booths at Grand Central. Why were they
used?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a throw off! That is what the English
would call shunting. Electricians use the same
word. It means diverting a current or a connection.
Cuthbert did this so that his trail
would be harder to check up. He thought of almost
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He missed his vocation!&#8221; interjected
Nichols.</p>

<p>&#8220;And misused his talents,&#8221; added Loris.
&#8220;Think of being clever enough to do all of those
things, and stoop to murder. He paid ten times
over. He must have been under that man Morphy&#8217;s
power. So many men were. I heard father
say that when Morphy was arrested. He
said Morphy was the most dangerous man in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>the world. That he would cause trouble sooner
or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew rose and nodded. &#8220;He did that!&#8221; he
exclaimed with conviction. &#8220;He came very
close to getting away with it. But for the magpie
and the fact that he &#8217;phoned from the prison
at the same time your father was murdered,
there would have been no clew. Cuthbert would
have entered this house after you were slain,
and removed the receiver. That would have
thrown the case into one of the unsolved mysteries.
Electricity is a dangerous tool in the
hands of clever crooks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It leaves no trace!&#8221; said Delaney, rising
and standing by his chief. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t made out of
anything except little shakes in the wire or
something like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew smiled good-naturedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery
to most people,&#8221; he said, turning toward
the windows and listening. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger mystery
to a woman than to a man,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good agent if properly used and kept
within bounds. It brings back life as well as
takes it. It creates and also destroys. No one
knows what it is. All that we do know about
it is its action on material substances&mdash;the
power to transform mechanical energy into vibrations
and then back again into mechanical
energy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a voice on a wire?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>&#8220;Yes, Miss Stockbridge. The mechanical
vibration of a diaphragm in a telephone transmitter
is changed to electrical vibrations, passes
along a wire and changes back to the same thing
we had at the beginning. Cuthbert took advantage
of this fact. All that was sent into the library
was Morphy&#8217;s voice on the wire. The
wire left no trace. The voice actuated the diaphragm
and at the same time the fine heating
coil at the cap on the cartridge. The energy of
the voice was sufficient to raise the temperature
of the coil. This raise in temperature flashed
some compound set in the wire. The flash
started the fulminate of mercury in the cap.
The cap exploded the smokeless powder. It was
a series of steps each a little higher than the
one below it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there any other way of doing the same
thing?&#8221; Nichols inquired, as he rose lankily and
stood over Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; declared Drew. &#8220;I can look back
over what I found in the technical books about
electricity and telephony and see several other
ways for Cuthbert to accomplish the same result.
The electrical pistol did not necessarily
have to be actuated by the human voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How terrible!&#8221; Loris whispered, with her
brow puckering. &#8220;Perhaps others will use the
same idea to slay their enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep it a close secret,&#8221; the detective
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>said. &#8220;It rests with us four, now. Outside of
us, there is only Morphy who knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How else could the pistol be discharged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two other ways that I see, Miss Stockbridge.
It would be rather easy to arrange a
little magnetic trigger in the receiver. This
trigger could be actuated by an excess of current&mdash;say
the connecting of a hundred and ten
volt lighting circuit on the line. It might burn
out the magnet wiring, but it would also release
the trigger and fire the cartridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like a door-catch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Like a door-catch operated
by a magnet or like the firing pin of a large
cannon. They&#8217;re not all operated by lanyards.
Some work with push-buttons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols passed his hand over his brow. &#8220;I
know another way,&#8221; he said, glancing down at
Loris. &#8220;There is a way which is far cleverer
than Cuthbert thought of. It could be done by
a tuning-fork or reed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221; exclaimed Drew. &#8220;I never
thought of that. A reed attuned to a certain
voice could be adapted to trip a trigger. Then
the loaded receiver could be set so that one of
your friends who had a peculiar voice, either
high or low, would slay you. Rather terrifying
revenge, that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond the pale!&#8221; said Nichols. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
bad this man Cuthbert didn&#8217;t exercise one-tenth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>of his genius in perfecting war inventions. He&#8217;d
have helped us a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew nodded and strode to the curtains at a
side window. He peered out, rubbed the frosted
panes, and pressed his nose against the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stopped snowing!&#8221; he exclaimed, coming
back and clasping Delaney&#8217;s arm. &#8220;You hurry
downstairs and telephone Fosdick that we are
waiting for him. Tell him to notify the coroner
that there&#8217;s a subject here which will interest
him. We&#8217;ll not explain everything to either the
coroner or Fosdick. No one save us shall know
the secret of the receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delaney,&#8221; said Nichols, as the big operative
started through the portières. &#8220;Mr. Delaney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; boomed back through the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask the Commissioner if he will release Miss
Stockbridge&#8217;s servants. It was an outrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; exclaimed Drew, striding to
the portières. &#8220;Tell him I said so, Delaney.
Tell him just what you think. Give it to him
strong! He bungled and he don&#8217;t deserve a bit
of sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Drew?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective wheeled on one heel and glanced
back at Loris, who had risen and was standing
with her arm linked within Nichols&#8217;. &#8220;Mr.
Drew,&#8221; she repeated with slow insistence,
&#8220;won&#8217;t you have another cup of tea before you
go?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>&#8220;That I will, Miss Stockbridge. We three
shall drink to the end of the case. Have you
asked all the questions you want to? I want to
forget this night as soon as possible. You were
too close to death to suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think of any more questions,&#8221; said
Loris, disengaging her arm and gliding across
the room. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get the tea. There is one
matter. I want to pay you for your splendid
services.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; exclaimed Drew. &#8220;Ah, Miss Stockbridge,
they were far from being splendid. I
lost my reputation in the first instance. I should
never have allowed your father to remain alone
in the library. That was very short-sighted on
my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t think of everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I underestimated the gravity of the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps father didn&#8217;t explain how dangerous
his enemies really were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think it was that, exactly. I
had been reading so many accounts of German
spies that I connected this case with one of them.
I took precautions against anything that a German
might think of. I didn&#8217;t figure on super-brains
of the criminal order. Cuthbert Morphy
had them!&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid appeared with the tray and hot
water. Drew took the cup from Loris with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>bow. He allowed the tea to cool as he glanced
at the two lovers. They had grown closer together
over the time of the investigation. Nichols
had that poise which is given to well-trained
army men. He never said too much. This was
a trait which pleased the detective immensely.
It spoke volumes for Loris and her judgment in
placing her trust in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I actually hate to leave you people,&#8221; Drew
said, finishing the cup. &#8220;But I must be on my
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris arched her dark brows. Her mouth
parted into a soft smile. Her eyes glistened
with moisture. &#8220;Harry is going, too,&#8221; she
said, glancing from Drew to Nichols. &#8220;He has
to go! I&#8217;ll sleep upstairs in mother&#8217;s old room
to-night. The maid can watch. Perhaps the
butler will be back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be back!&#8221; ejaculated the detective, adjusting
his coat collar and stroking his mustache.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see to that if I have to go over
Fosdick&#8217;s thick head. You can expect all of
your servants within an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy footfalls on the rugs outside the suite
announced Delaney. He came through the portières
rubbing his hands in the manner of a man
who was well-satisfied with his errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got them!&#8221; he boomed, glancing from
Drew to Nichols and then letting his eyes shine
on Loris. &#8220;I got Fosdick, first. I told him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>what I thought of him, too. I don&#8217;t like him.
Never did! He said he&#8217;d be right up and see
about things. He can see!&#8221; The big operative
swung toward his chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the coroner?&#8221; asked Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming as fast as his hurry-up wagon
will let him. I told him there was another&mdash;well,
you know what I told him, Chief?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective lifted his lowered brows. &#8220;Yes!
Yes!&#8221; he said hastily, after a keen glance at
Loris. &#8220;Yes. You did right. Now, get into
the other room and gather up all of the tools
and plaster-casts and every scrap of our own
evidence. Put them in the trouble-man&#8217;s satchel.
Set the satchel outside the door to the hall.
Then wait for me. I&#8217;ll be but a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney paused. &#8220;There&#8217;s one thing,&#8221; he
said in a half stammer<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8220;One thing, Chief,
that&#8217;s been troubling me while I was &#8217;phoning
to the coroner and to Fosdick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can have that magpie? I&#8217;m going to
give it to my wife&mdash;Mary&mdash;if I can. There&#8217;s no
bird in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew turned toward Loris who had drawn
Nichols to a window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can he have it, Miss Stockbridge?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; throated the operative, passing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>through the portières with renewed energy.
&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he added under his breath as he
started picking up the plaster casts and tools.
&#8220;That&#8217;s how we caught &#8216;Cutbert,&#8217; and I&#8217;ll
nurse the bird like a Grand Opera singer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris glided from out the curtains and
crossed the room. She stood a moment under
a cone of soft light which reflected downward
and brought out every detail of her gown and
girlish figure. She turned and smiled widely at
Drew who stood by the portières.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve almost forgotten something,&#8221; she said,
drawing out a chair and sitting down with a
graceful sweep of her skirt. &#8220;I&#8217;ve forgotten
that you are tired and that you have worked
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Drew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are tired and you have worked
very hard. Harry will bear me out in that. He
was just saying that you would make a good
major of overseas forces. Why don&#8217;t you join
the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew reached into his right hand trouser
pocket. He brought his hand out with a small
gold badge between his fingers. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already
joined the army,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a Secret
Service badge. Don&#8217;t you know that much work
can be done over on this side? A burnt warehouse,
for instance, is equal to a victory for the
Kaiser. My agency is almost exclusively devoted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>to Government work. We never mention
it, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Loris, reaching into a pigeonhole
and drawing out a small yellow check-book.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; she added, picking up a mother-of-pearl
penholder and inspecting the pen-point.
&#8220;I rather thought you would do your share. I
think everybody should to the limit of their
pocketbook and ability. Harry is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew bowed slightly. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, stick by
Harry,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;She&#8217;s a sticker
and then some,&#8221; he added, frowning toward
the check-book and the poised pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Drew?&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective took one step in her direction.
He waited then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Drew, how much money do I owe you?
I&#8217;ll pay you out of my account until the estate
is settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detective smiled broadly. &#8220;Nothing,&#8221;
he said, toying with his watch chain. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think you owe me anything in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. Your father retained me.
He was&mdash;was slain through my own carelessness.
I think I owe you something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let it remain that way.&#8221; Loris
turned and widened her eyes. A tiny pout
sweetened her mouth. Nichols came across the
rugs and stood by her side. He turned to Drew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be fair,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You certainly
earned your fee in this case. Why, you
look five years older than when you came up
into my rooms with that little pistol!&#8221;</p>

<p>Drew touched his mustache. He closed his
lips. Fatigue swept over him as he said huskily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve aged, yes. Well, I guess I have. The
responsibility was more than I expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; asked Loris, opening the
check-book.</p>

<p>Drew raised his eyes to the ceiling. A faint
smile brightened his olive skin and brought out
the fullness of his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five thousand dollars,&#8221; he said, without
glancing at Loris.</p>

<p>She dipped the pen into the ink well, leaned
her elbow on the leaf of the writing desk and
hastily scratched a check with angular writing
which had certainly been cultivated in a select
boarding school. She turned, waved the check
in the air, then rose and advanced toward the
detective, who had not lowered his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, holding out the oblong
of tinted paper. &#8220;I want to thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols stared at the detective. The soldier&#8217;s
eyes were like bayonets beneath a parapet. He
had thought the figure rather high. Loris had
no one to advise her save himself and the presence
of Drew had tied his tongue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>&#8220;I want to thank you,&#8221; repeated Loris.</p>

<p>Drew lowered his eyes and reached for the
check. He glanced at it, started folding two
edges, then smiled brightly as he crossed the
room, picked up the mother-of-pearl penholder
and dipped it into the ink.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll endorse it,&#8221; he said, flattening out the
check with his palm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll endorse it so that it
can be transferred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom?&#8221; asked Loris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to where it belongs. Do you think
that I could take it? It&#8217;s too much in the first
place. In the second place I&#8217;m going to do my
full bit from now on. What do you say, if we
endorse this over to the American Red Cross?
It&#8217;ll buy beds and bandages and it&#8217;ll help out
all around!&#8221;</p>

<p>Loris lifted her eyes beneath her down dropping
lashes. She smiled with tiny puckerings
at the corners of her mouth. The glance was so
archly sweet that Drew felt it was more than a
reward. He caught her mood and hastily
dashed off his signature across the back of the
check.</p>

<p>&#8220;You present it to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Take it
with my compliments to the treasurer of your
own division. I&#8217;ll venture they will not question
the signature.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nichols&#8217; hand crept out. It clasped over
Drew&#8217;s fingers in a soldier&#8217;s grip. The two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>men faced each other. Drew reached up his left
arm and patted the captain on the shoulder.
&#8220;Two bars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope to see stars
there,&#8221; he added sincerely. &#8220;Stars, when you
come back from the conquest of Berlin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be there!&#8221; declared Loris with
flashing eyes. &#8220;Harry will get them!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney peered through the portières despite
his instructions to the contrary.</p>

<p>&#8220;All set, Chief,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hear Fosdick
downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Coming,&#8221; said Drew, as he turned away
from Loris and Nichols.</p>

<p>The two detectives paused in the center of
the room. The mound under the splendid rug
held their eyes for a fleeting moment. The ends
of the telephone wires lay across the hardwood
floor. They glanced at these.</p>

<p>&#8220;No trace!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;We needn&#8217;t tell
Fosdick much. Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>Delaney held out the detective&#8217;s coat and
hat. Drew thrust his arms into his silk-lined
sleeves, pulled the hat down over his eyes and
swung as the big operative turned his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; whispered Delaney.</p>

<p>Loris Stockbridge and her lover stood under
the glow from the soft clusters of the inner
room of the suite. The captain held his peaked
cap in his right hand. He also was departing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>&#8220;Turtle-doves,&#8221; Delaney breathed with almost
pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Drew. &#8220;Ah, my friend, you
must remember that we were once that way ourselves.
But now&mdash;but now, Delaney&mdash;there is a
thing which is sweeter than love&#8217;s young dream.
It is a tired man&#8217;s sleep. I think I have earned
mine to-night!&#8221;</p>

engineer through Kentucky to catch the
trail, and when he finally climbed to its
shelter he found not only the pine but the
<i>footprints of a girl.</i> And the girl proved
to be lovely, piquant, and the trail of
these girlish footprints led the young
engineer a madder chase than &#8220;the trail

the banjo better that anyone else in the mountains.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
